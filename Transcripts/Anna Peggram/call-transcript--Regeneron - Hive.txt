time. 

0:01 | Anna
I don't know why the recorder came in twice, but never mind. I had two versions of it. 

0:10 | David
So you'll be sending out the invite then? 

0:13 | Anna
But if Teams works better for you, David, would you mind doing it on Teams? 

0:18 | David
And then just, okay, that would be fine. 

0:22 | Anna
And just include me. 

0:23 | David
Huh. So how do you pronounce your last name? Pegram. Oh, Pegram, just like it sounds. 

0:32 | Anna
Yeah. 

0:35 | David
Excuse me. 

0:39 | Anna
Slightly more interesting than my pre married name, but not by much. What was your pre married name? I was a Davis before, 

0:48 | David
David? Oh, okay. 

0:50 | Anna
Very common, especially in the UK. 

0:52 | David
Huh. Okay, Hive updates. So Marnie, you, two 30 to three o 'clock. I just want to make sure I'm... All right, so you'll be coming your way. 

1:06 | Anna
Perfect. And then, yeah, sort of catching up on the email threads. I'll sort of tell you my understanding so far, David. Sure. That's probably a good place to start. Let me know what I'm missing. Okay. And I'll also just kind of introduce myself as well. So I'm Anna Pegram, as we just covered off. I'm the Business Development Director for North America for Hive Learning. And I've been with the business for about six and a half years now. Started out at our headquarters in London and then moved to sort of our North American arm of the business about five and a half years ago. So I've been working, actually I spent the first sort of four years of my career here working on all of our client side work. So I knew Smita pre Regeneron when she was with Dow Jones, when we did our first bit of work together. And then Peter, one of my colleagues supported Regeneron. I think you might remember him, David. I think you worked with Peter when Regeneron worked with us last. So I think one of the reasons that Laura brought me into this was just to understand kind of where is Regeneron now, kind of what's going on. I'd love to know a little bit sort of why now in terms of what made you want to reach out and connect at the moment. I know Diana mentioned that there are some conversations happening internally, it looks like in the leader, leadership and learning space. So yeah, that's a little bit kind of about me and my role in this right now. 

2:34 | David
Yeah, and basically what happened with Hive, just from my perspective, and so you know from my perspective, all right, so we have three pillars within DEI in Regeneron. That's better workplace, better science, and better world. So that was in place prior to the makeup of our new team, as I just described it to you. And so I lead the better workplace pillar. And then I have a colleague who is leading our better science and then another leading our better world. Better science really is all about diversity in clinical trials. It's about, health equity, all those kind of associated topics around DEI and health since we are a healthcare company. And then the better world might be what you would consider your traditional externally facing efforts that companies have. But we do have or we have we do have a corporate community, corporate citizenship slash communications group. But the better world piece is more related to how that connects to diversity, equity and inclusion. Things like, you know, reaching out on from on stem for kids or how we become thought partners with the LGBTQ community externally or gender equity and biotech, for example, things like that. So that's the makeup of our group. And now that we are this new organization that's the umbrella is culture and development. The culture piece sits really in DEI. The development piece then becomes, you know, a product of learning and leadership development, organizational effectiveness, how we look at the future and the future of work. You know, all those kinds of things. So that's since April the first, we are now this larger organization. So within that, when we worked with Hive in the past, it was as a pilot program that I think went over very well. And it was Laura that reached out to Smita and then Smita asked, you know, is there opportunity to, you know, resurrect or Reengage or what have you with Hive. The the only downside that I saw from working with Hive in the past had to do with receptivity by the organization. So there were some groups within the organization that had an affinity to the kind of learning that you all offered, where people would engage with each other on their mobile device. They would have like that group learning, you know, that, you know, that was great, for example, with our group in what we it's our manufacturing group. There are more self contained compared to other parts of the organization. So I believe they got more out of it than other folks could have. I think part of it had to do with the way we engaged or maybe there was a lack of engagement and letting people know that this is possible. I think we could have done a better job internally to really organize the pilot in such a way that got more people involved. So that that's what that was. Now that I'm looking at and I would love to learn more about from there till today. What has been the difference in the changes in the improvements to Hive that may be able to connect the way we did not connect before? And again, with the less Thomson's learned of, was it something more that I could have done or Regeneron could have done? Or are there capabilities or ways of making this work maybe from the Hive Learning side? But that's overall. Finally, before I stop is that I believe that this kind of learning, this experiential learning is the way we should go. And that's where I want to get Dana and Marnie and others to weigh in based on what their vision is for curriculum or at Regeneron moving forward. So those are my thoughts. 

7:33 | Anna
Hmm. I appreciate it, David. And I think I'm just having a look at his calendar. I think what might make sense, I'll see if Peter might be able to join us tomorrow as well, because I think he's got a little bit more of that context on what could we do differently compared to last time as well. So I'll see if I can loop him in. What are the goals for you, David? Currently, the I know you said you kind of that's the direction you want learning to go. But what are you hoping to be able to sort of drive forwards within the business through learning or sort of through a new initiative? 

8:05 | David
Sure. So there's learning and leadership development, which involves a lot of a lot of resources that may or may not have to do with diversity, I. 

8:15 | Anna
and inclusion. 

8:17 | David
What I would like to do is blend in DEI and make it, as we like to say, embedded and part of embedded into the fabric of the company as opposed to it being a silo. So that's an overarching goal of mine. And As opposed to and there's still appetite for microaggressions, unconscious bias, you know, all those topics that are DEI related. Right. Because we do have some topics that's in place, but there's a hunger for. In one sense, a one stop shop, so if I want to get something, I just go on ahead and clicking and do self paced learning. But there's also an appetite for an instructor led learning, for example. But there's just very finite time for people to do that. We just had we had a program, for example, great example, actually, that we held last week. We prepared two months for this program. We invited and followed up, nudged, et cetera. 400 over 400 people. And we had and we had spots for 30 on one day and 30 for another day. We got 25 on the one day and we got 15 on the second day after 400 people had been invited. And it's nothing more than people's schedules because we invited senior leaders. We invited mainly director level and above individuals. So we knew there would be you know, there would be a challenge getting people there. But that was four hours per day. So it was a challenge. And and in August, as you know, from a vacation perspective, I called it a win that we got any So I say that because is I see Hive Learning almost. And again, maybe it's a Peter yourself can correct me if I'm wrong. It is a bit of a hybrid of that where people can learn from each other and reinforce each other's micro bursts of learning or whatever. I think that we don't have that. And Is this the right time for that? And then how do we advertise it and get make it viral? Because I think this is more being viral than to say, hey, this is something that you should do. It almost has to happen organically from that's the way that Hive resonated with me. But I don't know if that's the case or what other companies have done with it, et cetera. 

11:10 | Anna
Yeah, I think you're right in a lot of what you said, I think. So where we really lean in is how do you create the accountability and the consistency for ongoing and sustained engagement with learning around these, culture topics? So our area of expertise is how do you create that transformation by getting large groups of people to be going through A similar experience at the same time. So kind of like a school of fish. They're sort of all swimming in the same direction together. And you create that momentum and that kind of direction of travel that means that those 10 to 15 percent, which we know every organization has got, have no choice but to come on the journey to. So we're looking at who are the AT five percent that we can really target with that to scale beyond the 20 to 30 that you can get into those four hour workshops. So very much in terms of what we're looking to do. I think it all makes a lot of sense what you're sharing with me, David. And one of the stories which you may remember, Peter may have shared it with you in the past. That sounds kind of similar to where you were. It sounds like kind of when you did the pilot, you were more in exploratory mode trying to learn about new things. And now you're actually at the point where you're like, OK, we need a scaled solution to this. to help us kind of create the direction of momentum across the business, not just kind of in those pockets. It's actually Sun Life, different, slightly different industry to yourselves. You know, the insurance and asset management company based out of Toronto. Are you familiar with them? which one, TD? What's that? Sun Life. 

12:43 | David
Sun Life. No, I'm not. 

12:45 | Anna
Actually, they've got about 30,000 employees, sort of full time employees. They're 50 percent insurance, 50 percent kind of asset management. So as I said, this slightly different industry to you, but they had quite a similar journey to what you're describing. So maybe we can walk you and Marnie through that tomorrow to help with what could we do to get her feedback on seeing it in real life to kind of look at how you create the receptivity to the tool, how do you connect with the audience over time, and really look at blending into the fabric of the company like you sort of mentioned there. So I'll pull that through. But I guess my follow up question as well is just, what do you want to see change as a result of going in this direction and sort of pursuing a more scaled approach to your DE &I? 

13:39 | David
Yeah, and so when you say change, I think metrics, right? 

13:46 | Anna
So it could be metrics, it could be something else, but just the, what are you seeing at the moment that you're like, that's the thing that I want to see shift in the business? 

13:59 | David
It's hard to answer, but I would say that with a company, I'm hesitant because the word that comes to mind is culture. And culture is a very nebulous word, but we're trying to use Well, we start with what we call the Regeneron wave, which are the qualities and attributes from an organizational perspective that we pursue about doing the right thing, being curious. There's just five of them that we have. But that's very like uber overall. For this, what Hive or the content within Hive Learning, what we'd like to do is have, a, it's a common language, I would say around DE &I, a common language. So we have champions of DE &I, right? So we have people who, for instance, I chair the DE &I Leadership Council. They are director level and above individuals from all across the business. We just had a meeting with them recently, and they really want to be upskilled on know sometimes just the fundamentals and basics of dei others maybe further along and want to get better at what they already know and then being able to teach others as well right so there's different levels but the organization is only 35 years old and in that short period of time we're still at the ground level from a DE &I maturity and so there's the basics so what I want to try to get out of this is to be able and you know maybe it's too much to ask but just moving people along that continuum so that there's with that shared language comes a culture shift because people now aren't going to be butting heads about how do we define equity versus equality for example right which we're getting now a lot because of a lot of what's going on outside of the four walls of Regeneron right because of what's happening in higher education or etc and there's a debate about it when you're debating you're not really learning because you're debating your you're really sharing your own ideas, but not necessarily hearing other people's ideas. Yeah. And and sometimes there is good listening that goes on but so certain words trigger certain people and so when some people hear the word equity they hear somebody's taking something from me. And people say no it should be equality well we know that the data shows that this whole world is not equal and so there's no way for us to actually do that so how do you make sure that your allies for example for people who aren't necessarily as privileged as you even the word privilege will trigger people you see all of the all of that is what we're trying to solve for through a shared language. 

17:34 | Anna
yeah how do you see that you mentioned the I remember the word you used but I'm going to use the word sort of friction that is created through the debate through the challenges the conflict that potentially arises when people don't have the right language to create that consistency in what we're saying and the debating what's happening how do you see that show up at the moment how do you know it's there. 

18:01 | David
there's at certain levels so it's so it well it's by levels and so when it shows up with individual contributors who are saying that they're not getting a fair shake when it comes let's say to promotion or opportunities for new assignments etc that their bosses or their immediate supervisor may not quote unquote get it and that they need to be skilled on how to be better leaders and so that's one side and there's a variety of other things at the individual contributor love contributor level that I can add to but that's a general thematically that's a general you know And then there's. 

18:50 | Anna
Sorry, is that bubbling through 360 feedback engagement surveys? 

18:56 | David
no that's just it we have engagement surveys that do somewhat address that but we don't have enough concrete data to say to use let's say our engagement survey scores to say is that completely systemic but because of the way in my opinion, some of these surveys are laid out. And because the population level, you know, the amount of people who are feeding back, you get less maybe candid feedback, or maybe because of the numbers, you get people who may not want to answer certain questions or complete the survey who may have some stronger opinions, right? So that's manifest that way where we get direct feedback is from conversations. We have listening sessions, et cetera with some of our employee resource groups, for example, or where we had ad hoc when we put a few employees together and ask their opinions and there was consistency among different cohorts and of underrepresented groups, with the feedback that we got associated with what I just said, which was, you know, the manager, it's their manager relationship was a consistent theme, there were others, but that was one consistent thing. And then the other piece has to do with senior leaders who will debate about these words, equity versus equality. What problem are we trying to solve? We have an equal amount demographically of men and women with the organization. So why should we be doing anything for women? You know, you know, we've checked that box, which we have not because demographics don't equal engagement. right. And then at levels within the organization that we're trying to target also, for instance, at the director level and above, you know, because the these are this is our quote unquote bench strength for future leadership, succession planning, et cetera, that we're really trying to focus in on key future leaders within the organization. But then we have senior leadership who will debate about this equity versus equality. And why are we doing something for certain groups? You know, when we know, we should be doing the same thing for everybody. So so, that's where when and then, you know, it was, I was struggling with the word, but the culture could be impacted by a shared voice, shared common language, I should say, a common language, that if it's through as you describe a school of fish going in the same direction, people don't have to necessarily agree with everything that is said, but that you agree that other people think differently than you and that's okay. 

22:23 | Anna
Yeah, exactly. You will head you will start swimming in the same direction. Eventually, even if it's not because you're All singing off the same song, but yeah. 

22:39 | David
And then swimming in the same direction, because we're all of the same cause around our organization. Yeah, exactly. But that doesn't mean that you can't be comfortable knowing that the person next year is not like you at all. And that's right next to you. But that's okay. 

22:55 | Anna
Yeah, you still use your own individual within the system, but the business... AKA the school of fish. Right. Because there's not conflict within it. 

23:04 | David
Mm hmm. Yeah. The last thing that I will mention, too, is this concept that we hear about a lot is how things are going on outside of the organization and leave the organization leave those things that are outside and not people realizing that in order to bring your whole self to work, you are impacted by everything that's going on outside. So you will bring it. It's not something that somebody could shut down because, you know, now they're in the building. And so there has to be an understanding of that. So my lived experience or what I'm going through, whether it's as a single parent or if it's as a gay male or as a person who is, you know, who's, you know, intersectional and in their, you know, like a black Latina female, you know, I mean, there's different things that people have to deal with and they come from a different place. And there's no way to separate the outside from the inside, as you know. So and that's where the myopic mindset is in senior leaders is, well, just don't bring that into work and we'll be fine. Yeah. So that's those are kind of the bigger issues when you're talking about, you know, where that friction is. And and we try and I think there's pockets of people understanding that. But then there's still a lot of folks who don't understand that. 

24:56 | Anna
That makes sense. And so where are you at the moment, David, with all of this? I know in the email thread, just kind of picking up on a little bit of what I read there, that, sorry, is it Dana or? Dana mentioned 20 25 budgets and sort of decision making processes. So in terms of that timing, are decisions made already that, yes, this is a direction that you want to go in or are you still at the stage of trying to work out how to create, I guess, the business case for why you want budget on this as a team? 

25:36 | David
I think the decision needs to be made on what we're going to invest in, but we know we want to invest in these kinds of programs. 

25:44 | Anna
And do you have a set kind of amount that you're hoping to spend for 20 25? 

25:49 | David
That's where, you know, I need to talk to Dana about what that might look like based on some of the other resources that they're considering for 20 25. And how how's the what's the benefit of one versus another? Or can they live together different resources? You know, does this meet a niche that maybe is not yet being solved for with the other resources that she's looking at, which is, again, this that's her shop, that she's looking at all these learning resources and then the bandwidth and, you know, and capacity for implementing this? Because, I mean, you all could literally plug and play probably. But then there's still resources that we have to look at to actually, you know, implement it and make it happen. you know, from communications to follow up or during the making sure that things are going, you know, month to month and all of those things, as you know. 

27:00 | Anna
Yeah, no, I appreciate that. And when are you hoping to have some of these decisions made or actually be launching something out to your employees? 

27:13 | David
Decision wise, pretty soon. That's why we wanted to get on a call with you. And that's why, you know, Dana is out of town. But having Marnie be part of the conversation in the interim will be very helpful in terms of timing, just because in that way, You know, we can you know, we can make those decisions. So decisions have to be made in the very short term. I can't give you like weeks or whatever, but it's not much. 

27:43 | Anna
Thanks, everyone. 

27:46 | David
Because we have to be ready for our 20 25 budget fairly quickly. We want to make sure we add and include as much of some of the assets that we're looking for in that budget as quickly as possible. I mean, just see if Marnie did Marnie respond. No, she may not have seen the message yet. 

28:11 | Anna
So 20 25 budgets are allocated. Do you have a deadline that they're all going into? I assume it's like a sign off and approval stages. 

28:23 | David
Yeah, it's stages based on our initial projections and then they're this kind of iterative. So we'll say this is what our wish list is and they come back with whatever questions or modifications and then we go from there. But definitely by my middle of Q4, things should be baked. But don't quote me on that because things have sometimes not been baked. 

28:51 | Anna
Yeah, that makes sense. OK, I think that's a good place for us to think about. How do we get started tomorrow? I think what makes sense, David, tomorrow is let's catch up on. You mentioned Marnie will have some of the oversight into what's already happening. What are some of the alternatives that are being explored? I think that would be really helpful. I'll see if Peter can join us as well, because he can talk a little bit more to that. What do we do to really address the receptivity to the tool? And he'll have that insight on the pilot that you did together and the work previously. I think from there, what I think my plan would be and let me know if this, you know, obviously Marnie better than me. Let me know if you think this will work for her is to show her a little bit about how another organization has been on the journey to create broad adoption of an ongoing tool that you can kind of use to create that cultural agility that you need to kind of give them the resources and the focuses that they need as and when they need them. So you've got that constant kind of beating pulse in the business of what does this common language and consistency mean? How do we really focus in on blending the DE &I focus to all elements of kind of what we're doing as a business, but I think also be the listening tool for you. It sounds like one of the areas that's really hard right now is actually proper understanding where some of the gaps might be. And I may be way off the mark there. So please correct me if I'm if I am. But I think a lot of it at the moment sounds very manual. It sounds like it's a lot of kind of hands on time with employees to in those sort of listening sessions and focus groups to try and understand what's really happening and actually what you need as much as a tool to address the challenges that you are seeing as a tool to help you identify where some of those challenges might be with the culture. Is that fair? 

30:48 | David
Yeah, I think that's fair. I think that's very fair. When you when you think about if the tool can actually give us a pulse as to employee sentiment in a way that's almost real time and Much more. I mean, the whole idea of these listening sessions, et cetera, is to establish that psychological safety for people to be open and honest about what they're going to say. So if the tool can help that with that trustworthiness. That's that's a huge thing, because many times you it's like the garbage in garbage out with the surveys. People, if they don't trust, they will respond a certain way then. And if they do trust because we hear it when we talk anecdotally to people, it's like that's not what we're hearing. It's not in this depth or in this with this urgency sometimes in and even some of the verbatims that come out of the these engagement surveys that we have. 

31:53 | Anna
Hmm. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay, well, I think we've got a good place to start for tomorrow. And then off the back of the conversation tomorrow, we'll probably have some sort of follow up to get into some sort of identifying what a potential opportunity could look like together. Those would be our typical next steps and starting to get a bit tighter on the scope of work that could involve. And that's where we'll be able to give you the clarity of your budget conversations too. But I think let's get started with the foundations for one of a better way. And tomorrow, especially if we've only got 30 minutes, then we can find time either later this week or next week to reconnect and also from the sounds of bringing Dana to the conversation. 

32:33 | David
Yeah, and I would also say just a quick five minute overview of the of your current tool. So the tool, as you mentioned, what it looks like at a company that you're working with right now. And then, you know, of course, a discussion, et cetera. And and it's it would be introductory. So it's not like, you know, we're going to try to data dump somebody like money or even myself, because I mean, I read some of the and I could see there's this to me is quite a bit of a difference compared to what it was, especially your capabilities and things like that. I thought that was pretty cool. So, yeah, I think that'll work. 

33:17 | Anna
Perfect. All right. Well, I look forward to catching up again tomorrow afternoon and we'll have a great rest of your Monday afternoon in the meantime, David. 

33:26 | David
I love you. Okay. Same to you, Anna. And I sent you the invite, so it should be new. 

33:30 | Anna
I've got that through. I've RSVP'd already. So hopefully you've got that, too. Okay, perfect.
