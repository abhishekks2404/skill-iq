There we go. Yeah, cool. Brilliant there, thanks. So yeah, you asked me a little bit about me. So I am originally from the UK. My accent usually gives me away. That part. So was sort of based in London for a while. Actually, first before joining Hive Learning, I worked in strategy and innovation, actually in property development. So what I was really looking at is creating innovation policies in an industry that, let's be honest, wasn't really the most innovative in a lot of ways when it comes. So that was kind of where I think a lot of my focus for change came from. And I moved to Hive about six and a half years ago. started out in the London office where we are based. Our headquarters is in London. 

0:49 | Kenneth
where are you in London and where was headquarters? 

0:51 | Anna
So headquarters when I joined was in Hammersmith, but we actually recently moved up to. White City? 

0:58 | Kenneth
Where is that? 

0:59 | Anna
Just a little bit north of Hammersmith. It's on the central line. I don't know how well you know London, kind of around the A 40 if you're. 

1:09 | Kenneth
I know London quite well, actually. 

1:11 | Anna
Okay. So it's we moved offices so that our headquarters is now and then where Burnham Chalcot is based is the shared space with Imperial College Business School. So Burnham Chalcot and Imperial College have a joint venture where they have scale space is what it's called. And it's where sort of small, very early stage startups through to slightly more mature, sorry, but still small businesses kind of go as a sort of innovation hub. And it's a collaboration between BC and Imperial College Business School. So we moved there. But I shifted to North America and focus when we look to expand Hive into the US about five and a half years ago. So to begin with still focused on our client team, I was looking at helping establish our initial few clients in North America and grow them. So looking at our sort of growth side of sales, and then moved into a new logo team to sort of lead our direct customer sort of channels about 12 months ago. So I've been focused on North American markets in about five and a half years. And that's kind of what I do. I'm based down in Florida now, so Sticky. Humid. 

2:24 | Kenneth
Yeah, this is a tough time if you ever be in Florida. Whereabouts? 

2:29 | Anna
Jacksonville, so North Florida, at least less hot and sticky. But I cannot wait for winter, which is not something I ever would have said in the UK. 

2:38 | Kenneth
Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, Florida is a great place. So that's why I chose Arizona. Because, you know, the zero humidity makes a pretty big difference. Yeah. 

2:49 | Anna
Although I have seen people baking bread, like on social media and stuff in the black mailboxes, which I'm like that, that's a different kind of heat. 

2:57 | Kenneth
Yeah, it's one of those things, you know, like this, for two months of the year, Arizona is I always tell it is I use that analogy. It's just like when you I mean, I like to cook. So like when you when you're baking something, you open up the oven and you look in the oven and like a wave of heat hits you. Like that is what it feels like. But but that's only two months of the year and the rest of the year. It's just sensational. 

3:20 | Anna
Yeah. So is that where you're based full time? 

3:23 | Kenneth
Yeah, I'm in Vancouver right now. But but I'm based in I'm based in Arizona. And I live well, I mean, I really, to be honest, I bounce between New York, Arizona and Vancouver, pretty much most of the time. 

3:39 | Anna
Yeah, I'm very familiar with New York. That's where we started as Hive Learning when we sort of first came across to North America. So I spent a few years in New York. Love New York. It's got a special place in my heart. But it's also quite nice to get away every so often. It's. 

3:54 | Kenneth
very nice to get away every so often. Yeah, well, that shows you turn the corner and became a New Yorker. You know, it's very easy. It's very easy. Like people from London and people from New York, and I've lived in London for extended periods on three separate occasions. And it's very easy for like New Yorkers and people in London to just like, it's virtually, you know, the same sort of a little bit different than any sort of foundation levels, you know. But yeah, but you're right, though, like after a while, and by the way, London, you just want to just get the heck out, you know, and get into some place that's a little more a little more tranquil. So plus for me, like, you know, growing up there, I mean, I'm from Brooklyn originally. So, you know, like I had a big, you know, big long term healthy dose in New York. So I was ready to, you know, I can go back and swing in for two, three days, you know, Get the Robin done. Get the MoMA done. Get the Yankees done and just get out. 

4:51 | Anna
Yeah, now I love my trip up to New York. But what takes you to Vancouver, Kenna? 

4:57 | Kenneth
Call me Ken. My wife is from Vancouver. And so we're up here, you know, visiting her family. And this is a beautiful city. Have you ever been? 

5:08 | Anna
I've flown in and driven up to Whistler, but I didn't spend any time in the city. But I it was beautiful on the we landed just before sunset. So I mean, just stunning scenery. 

5:20 | Kenneth
Yeah, it's a really nice city. It's, you know, it's just got really kind of everything you want without the things you don't want, you know, like it's got, it's just the right size. And, you know, it's got a nice sort of young vibe. And the food is excellent. You know, it's multicultural. It's all the things you want in a city without being just too overwhelming, you know. So I highly recommend it to people. Next time you next time you coming in, don't, you know, before you head up to ski, like take it, take a day or two, and check it out. You'll you won't be disappointed. Yeah. 

5:56 | Anna
No, I hope to. I've actually just got some buddies who've moved there. They're done the thing that I'm not quite brave enough to do. But mid reach sort of mid thirties gone. What are we doing? Both quit their jobs and decided to move to a completely new city. And Vancouver is where they've gone. And so yeah, I'm keen to go visit them and been hearing a little bit about it through them. 

6:19 | Kenneth
Oh, you'll definitely like it. And there's and it's got a big sort of expatriate community to like, you know, you there's a ton of, you know, Brits and Aussies and just, you know, it's just got that kind of mix here. And, you know, big Asian influence, you know, big Indian influence. And so, you know, just sensational for me. For me, a city is, you know, like I can live without culture, but I can go find culture when I want it. You know, but if a city doesn't have food, I'm just not I'm not staying. And so this city has great food. And that's big. That's big for me, at least. 

6:59 | Anna
Yeah, something I miss that New York does well and Florida less so is good Italian food. 

7:06 | Kenneth
Oh, man, you can't get good Italian food. OK, so outside of New York City, let's just be really clear. There's there's some things you're just not going to get. First of all, forget Jewish food. Right. And I'm a born like, you know, I'm a huge diehard Jewish food guy. Like, I need good bagels and I need good pastrami. And you just do not find that outside of New York City. Yeah, you're right. So I get used to that. And then Italian food is hit or miss. Like all places usually have one or two. But like at scale, definitely New York is a better place for Italian food. London's an excellent place for Italian food also. 

7:46 | Anna
Yeah, I think those sort of mega metropolises have got a little bit of everything right. You're going to find something good. I haven't found good Italian food in Jacksonville yet, but that's probably not. 

7:56 | Kenneth
that might be tricky. A good pizza will be hard to like. That's another thing that New York does, although you can find good pizza elsewhere. But New York is good for a high concentration of excellent pizza. 

8:10 | Anna
Yeah, it's different foods instead, though. Much more Cuban food. Yeah. Exploring sort of Cuban food and other things. Anyway, I'd happily talk about food for quite a bit longer, Ken. But I actually really wanted to ask you as well. I was kind of having a quick look on your LinkedIn and I'd love to hear a little bit more about your role at the moment at Sugarworks and kind of what you're doing there. I think it's called sort of a growth advisor is what you've got there. What does that mean? Kind of what does it entail for you right now? 

8:40 | Kenneth
Yeah. So so as far as what I do, you know, I advise companies, you know, usually what I'll end up doing is, you know, fixing, building sales, marketing, sales operations teams, you know, whether it's, you know, standing them up and whether it's enablement. Whether it's expanding them into multiple geographies, you know, putting in a tech stack, you know, all those sorts of things. So that's the type of work that I do. And I've been doing that independently. Well, I've been doing it my entire career, but I've been doing it independently for, I guess, about 15 years now. And so with, Sugarworks is a very early stage company where I've worked with the founder before and she she's building a capability of essentially, you know, enterprise knowledge transfer using large language models and producing outputs from large language models for companies which are in various kinds of transitions. So whether there's a reduction in force or whether there's a large amount of layoffs, I'm sorry, retirement is expected. you know, other forms of transformation, consolidation of teams, expansion of teams, scaling of teams, anywhere where you have information and experience that's locked in the heads of smaller numbers of subject matter experts or departing employees, tenured employees. And you need to get that information out and get that in the hands of a broader universe of employees, whether you're bringing on new people into those functions or whether those roles are being assumed by other functions or so I'm helping her really just get this whole thing sort of off the ground. And so, you know, she has really no sales function at all there. So I'm helping her with a very literally at the very basics of setting these things up. But that's the kind of work that's kind of work that I do. usually companies will get me involved when they're at a stage where they just they need to bring in just accelerate their sales growth and they just don't have the experience to do it. Sometimes sometimes I'll do it, you know, when companies have made a hire that didn't work out like, you know, like a VP or, you know, CRO level hire that didn't work out. I'll just come in and help them sort of, you know, stabilize things and right the ship. So it's really that sort of work. 

11:21 | Anna
Hmm. Very interesting. Thanks. I appreciate that. And so is that something that you're doing sort of multiple companies at a time or do you just really focus on one? 

11:30 | Kenneth
No, I do multiple time. I should come do it with you. 

11:34 | Anna
Well, I certainly feel like there's lots that I still need to learn. So well, 

11:39 | Kenneth
I'm not I wasn't suggesting that I'm going to what I'm saying is people like, you know, who are in expansion positions have so many positions to play. You, know, you know, there's only so much capacity. And that's another thing that people don't always recognize when they build when they build companies. It's very there's a lot of moving parts of getting a really functioning commercial operation. You know, it's almost always underestimated. So. 

12:07 | Anna
and I think, you know, you talked a little bit about your founder at Sugarworks as well that you're working with in terms of issue when you're doing things for the first time as well. More more minds, more perspectives can help in such a different way because, you know, I am always learning every single day. I'm learning. It's things I've not done before. And that's the fun of it and why I love working in small businesses and being at that kind of growth stage. But it's also the hard part. 

12:34 | Kenneth
Yeah. And look, you know, there's no substitute for it. And I think that but, you know, there's a lot of aspects to it. Right. You know, there's figuring out, you know, there's so much before this to in very broad strokes. You know, first, there's just getting it moving. Right. Like you just got to get it moving, you know, and then there's the ability to constantly iterate and learn as you do it and incorporate those learnings into processes. you know and just constantly it's a state of constant refinement and you know there's so many pieces to it there's finding people they know there's talent development talent acquisition development that's a ton of work there's what's the right tech stack that's a ton of work you know there's what are the right processes that's a ton of work there's you know what what's the you know what is the right how does all that fit into a go to market and a product market fit assessment which is a big area that a lot of companies get wrong you know and really suffer from make you know over hiring or not targeting properly or not you know taking things like you know confirmation bias into their selling processes and things like this so like you know there's a whole range of problems like that you encounter you know and it's overwhelming for any one person to be able to do that and where does the where does the distribution of load go between sales and marketing that's a huge area where i'm always very focused and you know a lot of sales a lot of a lot of founders and especially investors will say i just throw sales people out of problem well that's like the hugest waste of money unless you really know what it is you need to you know where you need to direct those resources so and well that's so to really scale there's all that's required and usually you know no matter how talented a person is coming in you know most people don't come in most people don't ship with that range of experience. 

14:40 | Anna
yeah no it definitely makes a lot of sense in your sort of roles at the moment how long do you typically stay with an organization before you sort of well how long are you aiming for it to take to get them to the point that you feel like you can step away that's a really. 

15:01 | Kenneth
good question i think it depends on it depends a lot on you know well it depends on a lot of things obviously right you know you so depending on the stage of the company it's probably easiest if i had to sort of bucket it it's probably easiest looking at it that way like there there are companies that are like literally just getting like they're either just approaching an a round or at an a round and simply need to sort of stand up a function and they have no time of course to do it they're given absurd pressures from their investors you know to do it and so many of whom have never operated so you know there's this whole sort of get it all moving you know this sort of where to start what what's the base what's the base configuration you need to start to so i'll be really specific actually let me answer your question a better way so let's take this one example because there's a lot of examples i could give you but there's this one example so so this founder is just legendary i mean she's brilliant she is you know incredibly skilled incredibly educated and credentialed but right now she's at the founder led sales part of the program so she's harvesting her network which is vast but all rolodexes run out so like that's something that most founders hate to hear but all rolodexes run out and so you know you're not going to scale to a 1,000,000,000 dollar company with your rolodex you know you have to transition and also she's a brilliant person and her but there's so much locked in her head so you can parachute a founder in right first of all most people want to talk to a ceo you know so that's another dynamic that's poorly understood like you know if i call you and say hey i'm the ceo you're like hey i'm talking to a ceo chances are much better you're going to take my phone call right yeah so you have you get better access you know you have the full dna of a selling proposition fully baked into your soul right and so you know all other things being equal which they're never but you will have a good shot to deliver a selling proposition there's a big there's a big sort of have you ever been have you ever been have you ever been skydiving anna. 

17:35 | Anna
i haven't it's on my bucket list but i have not been. 

17:38 | Kenneth
so when you go skydiving right you know you're you ever see a picture of people skydiving and when the parachute goes up it looks like they go up again right there's that reduction in speed right so so when you're a founder trying to hand off and build an actual scale sales team you have to realize that those pieces like transferring the knowledge transferring what is organic into an actual structured process like those are big learnings and then where do you deploy the limited capital you get and then how do you get to the next race right so so that is those are a series of problems that that's what i'm that's one type of problem that i have solved in the past others are hey we just got a c round and now we want to put 150 people in a big sales center in scottsdale arizona right and that's a different thing and that's like okay let's go do that right like that's all different you know or i'm in europe and i want to sell to the us i'm in europe and i want to sell to the us so we take our best people like yourself and we throw you in the middle of a new pond and say go for that all right like what's involved there like okay does the proposition translate does the commercial and competitive environment translate you know those kinds of questions right so you know depending on the work i do is usually mixes of those things and but i'll you know i can work with the company just to do a few sessions of just drilling into you know and giving them what i think is recommendations on structure for you know six months 12 month 18 month progression of scale into different functions and roles and sizes you know others other times it's working i work best when i get to work with the company for a while and help them iterate through and just sort of run through these propositions and okay let's tackle you know sales effectiveness let's tackle you know marketing effectiveness i work best in medium duration projects like that. 

19:38 | Anna
a medium duration would be how long yeah they're really interesting i appreciate i really appreciate you sharing with me and kind of giving me a little bit of a look behind the curtain in terms of your process because i think it's really interesting to kind of hear and lots of the challenges that you're sharing definitely resonate both here and in previous roles that i've held at different so. 

20:03 | Kenneth
tell you what tell those guys to tell those guys to sign me up and i'll be your i'll be your guy and i'll help you do it for six months and then. 

20:12 | Anna
right well i'll tell you what i'll walk you through what i've got today i'd love your feedback and then we'll have a chat let's do it something i'd be really interested actually as i jump into this one of the things that we've been looking at i think where our proposition aligns and i just kind of want to plant this as a seed for you to think about is where like onboarding and helping with speed ramp time of new reps sort of speed to first sale is an area that we think we can drive a lot of value for businesses so we've been looking at investment rounds at who's getting funding who's likely to be growing who's actively hiring who might have these problems to help us identify people who might be in the market for looking for a solution like ours but given your sort of focus on businesses going through investment round i love your perspective when we get to the end of like what kind of round should we be honing in on that you think they're really going to have enough people that our solution is worth it and enough of a problem that scale is kind of where they're at because i think it varies i don't think we can totally always pinpoint it specific to around but i just really love your thoughts on that yeah sure happy to cool what i had planned was just to kind of run you through what we're thinking so far if that works ken i'm just kind of playing as if you were a sales leader that i might be talking to and sort of pitch to you in that way so that you can get a little bit of a sense of how we're thinking we should take this to market and i'll run you through a quick demo of the product as well so you can sort of see it in action in a couple of different ways and i'd just love you to ask questions as you go as well and tell me maybe what's missing if i'm moving on and you're like wait there's still this big gap please do just interrupt me if that's all right sure wonderful i'm gonna share my screen. 

22:08 | Anna
In a second, why is it not showing up? That is really bizarre. 

22:23 | Anna
okay i will have to share this way cool can you see that it's my brilliant so the way that we're looking at it sort of yeah looking forward to sort of introducing you to Hive Perform as well because i think when i spoke to you last time it was all about Hive Learning which is our sort of center business but what we're really looking at is how do you get reps and sales folk or advisors in insurance practicing more so that they execute better. So kind of stop practicing on your customers is the sort of premise of where we're already thinking. A little bit, because I know we did talk beforehand of how we're thinking about this. We've actually built a second brand now within the organization Hive Learning is what we've been for about 10 years. It's the tool that supports businesses to transform when you think about getting the right skills to the right people at the right time to help them do the job at hand. Hive Perform is where we're really leaning into the sales enablement focus which is really new for us. It's the area that we're testing much more is where we're getting that pull from our network and our existing customers where people need their reps to be practicing more so they can execute better and we're sort of thinking of this as like practice like an athlete so you can sell like a champion. You know we've just all been watching the olympics they you know performance day is such a small part it really is the tip of the iceberg with so much more of it being focused on preparation for them and i think sales shouldn't be any different there's a lot here but super simply Hive Learning we sort of think of it like your gym membership it's the place that you can go you can build your muscles you can practice but Hive Perform is more like your personal trainer it's the thing that's going to match you to where you are right now create the continuous improvement as you get stronger it will shift the practice exercises that you're doing to continuously sort of grow those muscles as well. and that's kind of how we're seeing some of the differences here as well. So just kind of want to give a little bit of context on the two because you will see sort of both and previous introductions as well was focused around Hive Learning. But getting into what is it so we as a business have been around as i mentioned for about 10 years we've launched about 20,000 programs now to date really honing in our expertise on what helps people learn how do adults learn and what makes them actually do things differently with the knowledge that they've gained because execution and understanding are two very different things and so we're led by data to help us create that continuous learning cycle that keeps people engaged we know that you can't just learn something once and do something differently it actually takes multiple touch points and then sort of supercharging that with AI we've unlocked the ability to scale that in a different way than we ever have done before and also consume the data of all the other tools that you're using that are also scaling with AI as they go. so the key things right now and what we're sort of seeing and feeling a lot from the market is like why shift to sales i guess is the question here partly it's so much of the time reps and sales folks just lack the right information in the right time you're actually just talking about it sounds like it's a similar problem with what your founder is trying to solve for it's a similar problem to The you know people are exiting the business but actually in sales what it often is markets and products are changing and you don't want your sales team to be selling two to six months behind where the product is. Time to first sale just takes too long as well which is a big cost for organizations and the amount of time spent doing admin versus doing value add tasks is just a sort of imbalance as well and this bubbles up into looking at sort of quota achievement data from 20 23 91 percent of tech organizations failed to hit quota last year that's a massive number when you think about what that means and the businesses that we're talking to we hear time and time again that actually as a business 10 percent of their reps are performing way above what's expected and the other 90 percent are not quite performing as well. And this is what's pulling them down. So you can kind of see it play out in both ways there. Just just curious as well, Ken, from your perspective, does this resonate? Are you seeing similar trends in sort of the businesses that you're working with or the people that you're talking to? 

26:50 | Kenneth
Yeah, I mean it's inevitable that you know I always describe it in terms of a bell curve. You know there if you look at a distribution of reps like you'll see you know the idea that 10 percent overperform and the rest underperform that is not at all uncommon. I think that you know target setting as an aside like I think the target setting Yeah and I know this just doesn't become a factor in your proposition here but part of the reason 91 percent of tech organizations fail to hit quotas is 91 percent of tech organizations don't have sales leaders that can actually properly create a quota you know so I think I do think that is a problem you know and so but leaving that and they're not going to want us to tell them that during a sell are they so like we're staying focused on what you're doing here I think that and maybe you'll come on to this with your tool but I agree with everything here I think the idea of admin is that we should look at what admin means because admin is defined very differently and depending on what your tool solves for you would probably want to emphasize some and de emphasize others and I can elaborate on that if you'd like now or we could do it as we go but you know I think and similarly training you know like training is almost always poorly done and training as an ongoing process is almost never done so you know there's this whole notion of you know I've trained you are now onboarded you know go and that is bad on at least two levels right you know you guys are a training company so you know training comes down to reinforcement right so so like that's the transition between like initial training and continued development you know a continued development program in sales the ones that I mean I've almost never seen one that's any good at all and so I think that but that also gets you into these murky areas of cheesy sales consultancies right so you don't want to be there either but it is important to realize that the real key here is the reincorporation of learnings right like if I if I'm pitching you like what we're doing now what you and I are doing now right you're talking to me and you're talking to others we're giving you feedback you're looking at your proposition from end to end and saying you know how do I make this how do I make these bits of feedback work across this range of possibility and so you know so like what does that really mean so okay if nine percent if our if nine percent you know extract you know interpolating this on to personnel if only nine percent of personnel are hitting their target what are we doing to understand what those nine percent are doing well versus what the rest are doing right and also when those not when those nine percent encounter problems or you know pitch a proposition that we as an organization have designed how are we taking those edge cases and other learnings and incorporating those back all the way upstream right yeah you know those that is not and then when you combine that with the you know the ramp times being I mean I have this conversation with a guy I've known for 20 years I've built three businesses with him he's still he and I still have this conversation he's like whatever I do a company he asked me to help his companies and he's like yeah we get someone ramped in six months I'm like how many times do we have to have this conversation it's like no we cannot you know like you know we just can't you know like so anyway I think these are the right topics and depending on how your solution attack attacks these problems you know there may be suggestions I would make that are. 

31:07 | Anna
you mentioned the kind of nine percent just curious can I know this is a big question what do you think the nine percent are doing differently those top performing reps that do consistently over perform in your experience date have you noticed any key themes in yes. 

31:24 | Kenneth
yeah 100 percent first of all they're highly structured you know people who the you know sales is artistry on top of solid process you know they're they have intangible skills that are impossible to train generally and then they have and then they have tangible skills that are the way to move the curve for the lag or flagging forward is to improve the process and the enablement right the you know the out in front of that the best people are highly organized they have a they have a process that they follow you know they're also very coachable which is really crucial to they and they are very good listeners you know that the best salespeople the worst of salespeople are the ones who talk too much right and so but the structure is the thing that you can provide you can't turn someone and into an empath right but you can give them process rigor highly you know good targeting which is constantly refined and the right tools so that they're in the best position as possible to convert when they reach an engagement but that is really what it comes down to you know it's empathy and discipline. 

32:51 | Anna
yeah no i think you're spot on with some of those and i think the coachability piece goes hand in hand with good listener. 

32:57 | Kenneth
100 percent and that and that's why the best sales people most of the sales people best sales people also make good coaches right and i think that is why you know that's why also when you recruit people for sales you know i will recruit nine times out of 10 i will look for sports i will look for military i will look for you know fundraising you know any forms of leadership because coachability is a huge but these are considered to be intangibles but they are trainable to a degree right they are trainable to a degree. 

33:37 | Anna
yeah no i appreciate it i do want to move on because we're having a great chat but it does mean that we're moving through our time quite quickly so coming back to that kind of macro problem there the other reality of it is there's a lot of tools already in this space so just sort of getting real for a minute 4,000,000,000 dollars was spent last year on sales enablement which is a massive amount of money i'm not surprised to see that number myself but it's huge but not only are we seeing the people aren't necessarily hitting quota we're also seeing from salesforce's state of sales report last year that 57 percent of buyers actually said that sellers can't even answer their questions which is not great when you talk about conversion rates ken as i'm sure i don't need to tell you so you know guys i know i've reported things like buying groups are changing the longer and more complex buying cycles there's too much information the sellers can't keep up with the product changes these are a lot of the trends that are informing kind of why we might be seeing some of this mismatch but ultimately what this is still telling us is that there's a massive gap lots of money is being spent but actually the impact off the back of it maybe is not giving the results that businesses need right now so how we see this and i will caveat this but this is our view of the world but the way that we see this is two big things play into this one of it one of them is so high perform very much plays in the sales enablement space that's where we see ourselves i'll get to what the tools themselves are in just a second but the way that we see this is what some of these other businesses are doing really well is pulling together content they're creating great sort of knowledge repositories they're pulling together information that people need but what we're looking to do is how do you really get your reps in a consistent loop of analysis and learning so that they're practicing when and where they need it so that's what we mean by active relevance and the social piece actually ties with what you were saying just before ken where you can then get visibility of what your top reps are doing well you can actually start to feed that back into the loop and create the cumulative benefit across the business where if everyone can get better just one percent each month that's a lot of money across the year and so that cumulative benefit across the business is what we mean through the sort of social and the kind of active approach to what we take as well. 

36:07 | Kenneth
yeah i and i think that's it i mean depending on how you tackle the problem that really is it i mean you know there there there's a lot we could go into why don't we walk through a little bit more of your presentation and then i can feedback what i whatever i can that can help you. 

36:24 | Anna
yeah i'm going to skip past a couple of bits because we've sort of talked about it already so actually this one i think you know the key pieces are connecting inputs and outputs is probably the bit that we've not touched on you just talked about discipline and practice and i think making it as relevant as possible to what those reps are doing off the shelf just doesn't work in sales actually where sales folks are often falling down is converting that what does it mean for me i need to think about this in my context my market with my products so connecting the inputs with the outputs what i mean by that is inputs are things like you know i talked about gong and what that looks like so where are we capturing the in the moment what's the history our crm is tracking our activity what's the knowledge that's why we're thinking about content so our approach has four very modular tools within it which are these four you can see in the middle depending on the business you we know you'll have a pre existing tech stack so this is really designed to slot in to fill the gaps that you have in your unique kind of ecosystem the. 

37:24 | Kenneth
right off the bat you're missing some really crucial okay so this your everyday interface is the idea as well to take what's in things like slack and teams. 

37:35 | Anna
so what we look to do is surface up into slack and teams so that's where. 

37:40 | Kenneth
no i would argue you would need that as a source and the reason why is because these days there's so and also you need to i mean i just email in this you need email too yeah and here and here's why because all this all of this content is happening in systems like that we're at right like you mentioned before fidelity to keeping you know date systems up to date first of all i have yet to see a hubspot instance that ever in my entire career that is not a total freaking disaster it takes me when i'm fixing a company it takes me months to unwind shitty best practice in salesforce on hubspot months to do so those are those should be sources for sure right but at the same time they're very poorly relied upon like if you if you and i are on a sales team nine times out of 10 we're having conversations in slack or teams right if i'm really getting feedback from a customer five times out of 10 or more it's an email and so those have to be sources you know that are inputs into this if you are ever to get like true insight on you know on selling into particular types of clients so i would strongly urge you to think about that. 

39:05 | Anna
Yeah, that's definitely an interesting one. So I totally see the data importance. 

39:19 | Kenneth
It's it's here's what here's what's very likely to happen versus what's less likely to happen anna just talked to microsoft you know heard these cool things you know emoji happy joy some rando link send right you read that and go back hey ken happy joy four more interesting things, more random things. Let's go get beer. Right. But inside that. Right. But here's what does not happen. I stop and say, you know what, Anna, I'm not talking to you anymore. You, perfectly bright and engaging person. Instead, I'm going to stop and I'm going to go to Salesforce and type all these things in Salesforce. So if you really want to get up to get topical information at the hands of a rep about an industry, a product, a company, a competitor, more often than not, you're going to find it in Yeah. In systems like that. 

40:21 | Anna
Yeah, no, you're right. And I will, I'll definitely take that one away and think about how that fits in. So that the broader piece for now, though, the way that we are thinking about it is. 

40:33 | Kenneth
Oh, most people are gonna like this, by the way. Don't get me wrong. What you got here is good. I'm not saying it's not good. It is good. 

40:40 | Anna
Well, the sidekick bit, the bit at the bottom there, that's about putting your knowledge and your information that exists in like we use Google Drive. My Google Drive is both the best and the worst thing that I have available to me. Best because it's got all the information I need. Worst because I can never find it. Yeah, right. And that's where my marketing resources set is where my sales collateral sets. So plugging in all of those things and then having your in the moment access to it through Slack and Teams. so that you can question it is what Sidekick looks like. So it's about giving people that rather than your CRO or your head of sales being walking FAQ to all of your reps when they need information, it's about funneling that into a single place where they can get really quick responses to the information that they need. 

41:27 | Kenneth
I would also add, I would also add where's so, okay. So you have Gong and call AI. So your assumption, is that conversations are all happening over these platforms. In other words, not on zoom or, Google meet or. 

41:43 | Anna
So not, they don't necessarily need to be, not everybody will have a cool recording software. So, you know, they will slot into zoom. Google meet, Teams, et cetera. You can, depending on where our business is in kind of their adoption of different tools, that's where call AI is actually one of the Blenheim Chalcott businesses. So we can provide that to folks if they don't have something. Gong is the one that we come across the most often that it already exists. Or if people just don't want to record, that's where we rely on more manual note taking and things that have been captured in either emails or Salesforce HubSpot, et cetera. 

42:20 | Kenneth
Yeah. I mean that Gong is, so just Gong alone limits you to a certain size audience. Gong is an expensive tool, right? And it's also expensive, to administer, and install. So, you know, just as a heads up like, that alone is that's, it's a highly successful platform, but, it's not one that's everywhere. Right. 

42:47 | Anna
Yeah, no, I do. I appreciate that. I think, our ICP at the moment, the way we're thinking about it is businesses typically sort of about 500 employees and bigger. And sort of our target industries would be tech, insurance, some retail and auto folks in there. 

43:11 | Kenneth
What's, what's the name of that really terrible mom Microsoft CRM? What is the name of it? It says the Salesforce competitor that Microsoft dynamics, yeah Yes. That should appear on this picture somewhere probably too. Hmm. Because when you start talking about companies like that, chances are much better that they're going to have dynamics, like law, especially large, really larger companies. Because you know, like a lot of them have made commitments to SharePoint for things like portal building, and, you know, so just as a heads up, that's probably not a core, not a bad idea to, at least start to be aware of. You see dynamics with much larger companies. You don't see dynamics usually with smaller companies because it is just nightmare. 

43:59 | Anna
Hmm. Yeah, no, I'll have a look into that one. I appreciate that as well. As we sort of follow our way around the loop, Buzz Facilitator is where your teams will practice. So Buzz Facilitator can slot into your sidekick. So actually you can access it from Teams and Slack. So five minutes before a call, you can practice your introductions, you can get feedback. They're very focused, targeted experiences that you can go through, either set by the rep themselves so they can take some autonomy over it or set by the organization. Or facilitator can slot into your more formalized training experiences, which you might do on more of a monthly basis. So within slack, you might do daily to help you prep ahead of every conversation you're having. And within your sales training experience, you might do monthly or quarterly in line with your more formalized training. 

44:43 | Kenneth
One thing you might want to consider here too, is LinkedIn because, you know, remember like a lot of the times research, typical research will include looking at who it is you're speaking to. Yeah. Right. So I'm going to want to know who you are before I get on the phone with you every bit, as much as I might want to know, you know, and I think to the extent it's possible, and I realize this can be, this part can become really overwhelming, but You know, you may want to consider sort of news or other social inputs just so that there's topical, right? Like, you know, because those are the kinds of things like most salespeople will prep themselves with who they're about to talk to. Right. And then they'll try to find, you know, other recent company information on that. So I was just using clay. Have you ever just used clay? Have you used clay? 

45:38 | Anna
Clay, what's clay? 

45:40 | Kenneth
Clay is another AI built. It's basically, it's a universe building tool that uses AI queries, AI driven queries to do some interesting adjacent stuff for sales. Like you can point it at a LinkedIn profile. It'll scrape a LinkedIn profile and process the data on that profile, you know, or you can, or it'll, scrape websites and process the data on that websites for certain kinds of information. It's very interesting. Yeah. That's the one. Hmm. I can, I'd be happy to, if you want to set up a separate time, I'd be happy to walk you through it if you want to have a look at it. But, it is, it's a research assistant tool, which goes back to the question of admin, right? We should really discuss what we mean by admin, because this is really important, right? There's, there's different kinds of admin that different teams ask their different sales leaders ask their teams to do, right? Am I looking up companies for people to talk to? That's one kind of admin, right? Am I entering stuff into a CRM, or other, you know, tickets, ticketing system or whatever other systems are required, you know, to log my activities and notes. That's a different kind of admin, right? Am I, am I cleaning up my pipeline, you know, and types of admin, and, you know, making sure that the dates are right and the forecast look right. And, and my, I see what my, that's another kind of admin. So it is important to distinguish between types of admin in order, to better, you know, put your proposition in the right sort of slot. You know, meeting prep is a, is another type of admin for sure. Pre and post meeting, you know, is, you know, those are two sides of that coin. You know, but there's also just logging it in things or, you know, and then looking at where I stand with respect to, my quota, right. That's a type of admin. And then, you know, or, hey, Anna, like I know a lot of people, especially who have more junior sales forces will tell their teams, okay, you know, you've got to go find, you know, 100 prospects a month, right. That's part of your, you know, your task. then they are going and doing company research in tools like clay or Apollo, you know, so, and I'm not suggesting you need to gang tackle all these things. I'm, what I'm suggesting is you need to look at, the relative value add of those types of admin, and the relative productivity gain of those types of admin. When, you know, when you think about productivity. Yeah. 

48:27 | Anna
Can I ask a question on the slide itself? So the purpose of this slide and what I'm trying to communicate here is what are our tools? Yes. That's, that's my purpose here in my story is like, you know, we've sort of talked a little bit about the background. We sort of set the scene and then it's like, okay, what do we actually do? It's about on demand sales knowledge. It's about practicing your skills. It's about having the right content to support your teams. And then it's about analyzing all of this. You can split your gaps. That's the kind of short version. I wonder if actually there's too much going on this side. 

49:06 | Kenneth
This slide's too crowded. It, it, you know, and I would say, I would take, I would equate your modules with the actual tasks that are being undertaken in more specific terms. So, you know, if you did, this would be three powerful slides or day of the life oriented slides. What am I doing? I'm preparing for a meeting. What am I doing? I'm post morteming a meeting. What am I doing? I'm, are you laughing at me, Anna? I see slides. 

49:35 | Anna
Oh, I'm laughing because I'm pulling something up that, we've been working on and I wonder if it's a better fit. I'm just going to pull it up in the background. But yeah, no, I totally get where you're going with that. I'm also laughing because it was Lee that suggested that we did it. 

50:17 | Kenneth
I mean, I have a few more minutes beyond this if you need more time or if you have more time, I can give you another 10 minutes. 

50:24 | Anna
Oh yeah, we're right at time. Actually, if we could just overrun a little bit, that would be super helpful. But this is one I was going to pull out, which is more of the, what are we focusing on? So the four tools, the idea is that Sidekick you connect with every day. There's maybe more detail needed here based on what you said, but Facilitator you connect with weekly. It's where you practice creating. 

50:44 | Kenneth
Yeah, I would link it back to actual selling processes, you know, like what am I actually doing and what am I using these things and what are they giving me? You know, like, so, okay, you know, and think of the cadences that sales teams undertake and how does this help those, right? You know, knowledge sharing, is terribly poorly done, you know, just by way of example, right? You know, you, like senior people or top sellers almost never really feedback. Case studies take too long to ever produce. Just thinking of it really like, what is a day in my life? So I'm a salesperson. I'm a salesperson selling, selling B to B SaaS, to, you know, I have a, you know, I have a territory of a 1,000 companies, you know, what am I, what am I doing sort of every day, right? First I'm, first I'm assuming I have, okay, so let's first assume I don't have my list. I'm told Anna, your territory is, is light manufacturing. You know, on the Eastern seaboard of the United States, right? So, you know, I have nothing for you. Go find that, right? Okay. Now what am I doing? I'm searching for companies. I'm searching, you know, I'm building lists of people, right? I'm seeing who might be the right people in there to talk to, right? Okay. Got that list. Now I'm selling to it. What am I doing? Okay. I'm sending out 100 emails a day. You know, I'm looking at what's working. I'm writing those emails. I'm seeing who's opening my emails, right? Oh, and then all of a sudden, boom, new product comes in out of the blue from the product team. I look at that product. Okay. Do I understand that product? Yes. No. Got to call up Anna, the product person, because she understands, right? Got a brief thing. Okay. Now I got it. Where's my collateral? Now then who do I point that new thing at, right? Okay. Now I got this cool new thing. I think these people will be interested in it, right? You know, then I get, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dialed out, I dial from this right okay my team won these 13 deals this week how right okay where's my summary of those deals why did it work why did it not work let's look at the 15 that did or that didn't work why didn't those work right you know and then that all real it resolves itself qualifying notes like what you just said with Gong like that is huge to know okay like what qualifying signals are coming at me that am I catching them yeah right like how do you zero in on those transformative things right and then all of that becomes better education and how and making onboarding material dynamic like to get closer to your sweet spot making onboarding material dynamic and reincorporation of learnings into onboarding materials that is huge right How much can we take? And then as those get as those become better then they become available to meeting prep right so it sounds to me like you've got a lot of stuff here related to meeting prep which is awesome right that's huge to be as briefed as possible going into a meeting. 

54:38 | Anna
it's more about practicing before going into meeting that we're really focused on. 

54:43 | Kenneth
well practice when you say practice is your expectation that I'm role playing prior to actually conducting a meeting or you and I are role playing prior to my conducting a meeting you're the manager I'm the seller where we're role playing is that the thought. 

54:57 | Anna
so it's a few things I'll bring it up and just show you super quickly so can you see my slack yeah cool so this is our instance of sidekick in slack with a little bit of facilitator so this is it's kind of my access to information that I mentioned so marketing resources we do these things called gen AI cohorts integration capability do we integrate with teams quick updates with links to the right information for me to sort of follow up and resources for me to check with positioning so what makes us different to a lego our you know let's drop me to the quick summary here you know this is the sort of stuff that's going to be important for me to be able to objection handle effectively or this is where I mean sort of practice as well okay I'm about to go into conversation I want to practice introducing Hive so what we have here is my conversation yesterday where okay I gave it a really bad intro on purpose and we have a quick conversation but then it's about okay break the scenario give me some feedback so this is them pulling from our sales Academy which is the resources and training material that we sort of have internally and the material within here isn't what's different it's the ease of access to really transform this in terms of how sales reps are going to use it and that's where we see it it's the regular access it's a regular is the introducing it to the idea of work so that it really is that one percent improvement all the time that's constantly growing with you like a personal trainer rather than the gym membership that you've got to remember to actually go to so this is sort of pulling out what I did well which was not much because it was a really bad intro and then my areas for improvement which is giving me the sales training I need when and where I need it including an example of actually what good looks like so that I can kind of use that moving forwards so that's what we mean by practice you can also use it to you know if I wanted to put in here give me a quick summary on this business if it's got access to that information but I really like your idea of how do we point it at LinkedIn or how do we integrate with tools that are already doing that. 

57:03 | Kenneth
yeah because it's also about the people like that's good by the way that's good you know and I think and definitely there's great utility in that I think though like what about the people what about the competitors like getting people ready for competitors is really tricky especially you know especially with like for instance AI tools like just like everyone and their grandmother is releasing an AI tool right now you know it's like cannabis was a few years ago and like oil was 150 years ago everyone's in it and it's gonna shake out bitcoin another shitty technology and it's eventually it's all gonna shake out there'll be like three winners right you know and so in this case is the same so I think but I think it's more about it's that so what you had was really good if you could extend that to other forms of situational awareness you know that would be really useful right tell me a bit more. 

57:58 | Anna
you mean situational awareness? 

57:59 | Kenneth
well you mentioned you've mentioned bits of it yourself on this chat like we you know you're not walking you don't own you don't own the sales environment as a salesperson anymore right you walk into the middle of it with a particular weapon you know you don't know you know there's competitors there's buy in consortia There's internal people talking there's you know externalities if they are if they apply like government or news you know there's a whole variety of circumstances there's movements of people you know there's a whole people's own prior experience and potential you know confirmation bias coming in like all of those things are things that impact success in a sale right and so you know you to you know to what you have there is very good and it is but it is it's a single perspective thing right how do I sell what I have better right that's very good right and that is very much under delivered and sales enablement so has a huge piece to bite off but then there are other pieces as well right what are your peers doing you know like those kinds of things are always involved in conversation with especially with earlier stage prospects and so you know is there something already in place you know that competes with my solution is this a brand new sale or a competitive sale things like this are all part of what you have to understand when you engage someone for the first time especially and so I would say you know and I think that the challenge with the source material for what you have in there is that unless it is really constantly nourished with immediate topical information you know it can become stale quite quickly or may lose relevance depending on what you walk into and that's part of the reason why slack is so good because you know I mean first of all let me preface this by saying I hate slack I mean it is just a poor first of all and it's like people are so listen we have this was like aol this is aol com. let's just be really serious here like yeah. 

1:00:30 | Anna
a love hate relationship as well. 

1:00:33 | Kenneth
yeah you know but inside of there is like a is a rich amount of information to call from which is almost always more immediate so here so your what you showed me might say here's the ways to sell my tool which is crucial and really important but slack might have hey here's what 15 people just said about an alternative to our tool right from conversations that two sellers may be having with each other or that a seller may be having with their manager or the seller and the manager may be having with the product team or the engineer engineering team here's what went wrong with the engineering team right like okay I tried to do this what do we need to have in place like those all of those pieces of the situation the more you can be armed with that the better and then you know and then delivering that as you have do are doing in near real time during a conversation right so you can say every time the word you know dynamics comes up you know then they can search for dynamics and here are five here are five things our customers tell us have told our prospects have told us about dynamics. 

1:01:43 | Anna
yeah no definitely a lot to think about Cam I know we sort of said a few minutes extra we're sort of at that point but I'd love to actually you mentioned the you offered up the opportunity to kind of see how you're thinking about clay I'd love to actually see what you're using a tool like that for and I'd love to take away a few of these notes and sort of bring back a sort of iteration to you as well if we could set up some time to do that would that work for you. 

1:02:10 | Kenneth
of course would you also would you send me a transcript of this meeting also. 

1:02:15 | Anna
yeah absolutely I can share the recording to it no problem. 

1:02:18 | Kenneth
yeah that would definitely that would definitely help just or the written one these you pull out of it just shoot me that well anything minus what's proprietary to what you're trying to do that I should I shouldn't see but anything beyond that would definitely it would definitely be helpful. 

1:02:32 | Anna
yeah no totally I'll share the kind of summary that it creates has. 

1:02:37 | Kenneth
been helpful Anna because I feel like I keep ranting at you. 

1:02:40 | Anna
no it is really helpful I think in particular thinking about what I've shown you in your response to it is really valuable insight to see like where your head goes as you're seeing different parts of how we're thinking about this and where that aligns with what I was trying to communicate to you and where it doesn't I think the most insightful bits are actually where it maybe hasn't aligned because that tells me where I've got the most work still to do to kind of improve it so that's kind of where I want to take away and iterate. 

1:03:07 | Kenneth
yeah what you look what you showed me was really good do not doubt I mean basically it replaces the need for some like internal experts standing by to answer questions that is huge that is huge so I do not want to diminish that but I think that's only one piece of what you walk in and encounter. 

1:03:25 | Anna
yeah and there's the what are we able to do now and how do we feed future bits into the roadmap as well so there's lots of really valuable stuff that I can take from this Ken so I do really appreciate it when would be a good time to reconnect for you. 

1:03:38 | Kenneth
why don't we I mean this time of day is usually pretty good so what. 

1:03:45 | Anna
for me as well I'll cross over with the UK means that my mornings are usually chaotic between customers and my internals but actually this time next week works really well if we could do that. 

1:03:56 | Kenneth
yeah let's do it let's do it just go ahead and send me a meeting request for that well. 

1:04:01 | Anna
Let's try this out. See if you get it. 

1:04:07 | Kenneth
You're sending it to Ken Reed at, right? Ken Reed at Gmail? 

1:04:11 | Anna
Ken Reed at gmail com. yeah all right let's see what we got hold on it's coming now all right I've just said it all right if you don't get it this time I have no idea what is going on there are some magical Here we are. It's come through. 

1:04:32 | Kenneth
has to come through and the answer is yes. That's fantastic. The answer is always yes just saying it's all good. 

1:04:41 | Anna
my other just question for you as you wrap up Ken you've seen a little bit of it I appreciate we haven't gone into full detail with it but is there anyone else that you know right now who is maybe looking for a tool like this that would be interested in trialing it with us or maybe who has experience in sales and would be interested in giving me a little bit of feedback similar to how you've done? 

1:05:00 | Kenneth
yeah let me think about that I'm happy to point you at other people so let me think about that I mean I have some yeah you know what I do have some people you should speak to for sure let me reach out to them first and let me send me here's what you should do send me like a intro an intro email that you would normally send to someone and I'll forward that on to a couple people I'll say hey these are sharp guys and you know Anna's a star like you should talk to her and see if there's a fit. 

1:05:27 | Anna
okay great yeah I'll do that I'll follow up shortly okay. 

1:05:37 | Anna
brilliant all right well it's been fabulous to see you Ken I'm looking forward to next week as well and I really appreciate all the insights that you shared with me. 

1:05:47 | Kenneth
it's my pleasure you have yourself a nice day stay cool and dry down there. 

1:05:52 | Anna
yeah I think you know that's what is it four o 'clock now the routine after all afternoon thunderstorms rolling in at some point so I'm sure. 

1:06:01 | Kenneth
time to go for a walk on the beach fresh air on the beach baby. 

1:06:05 | Anna
I did that this morning actually I don't have my phone with me otherwise I was going to show you a picture I had a beautiful sunrise with the dog on the beach so there was there were some perks to living in Florida. 

1:06:15 | Kenneth
there you go well I'll expect one in my inbox before we meet again. 

1:06:20 | Anna
All right. Great to talk, Ken. OK, bye. Bye.
