Perfect. Awesome. So we'd love to start off with just a couple of quick introductions, but to kind of set the stage and make sure that I'm remembering our conversation right and that we touch on the things that were important to you. Ryan, we spoke on the phone On Monday and we're just talking about what you know some sales AI and innovation that you were thinking about noodling around about bringing in for OSLRS. You shared about wanting to have more of a front row seat to data on how your folks are interacting with and engaging with sales training. And being able to improve some of that sales coaching, especially since you have kind of a unique use case with your folks in those brick and mortar stores and possibly only getting coaching like every 45 days or so. Am I remembering our conversation right? Am I missing anything so far? 

0:56 | Ryan
Roughly, you're on target. 

0:58 | Charlie
Perfect. So I'll allow for a couple of quick intros. So Ryan and Anna, if you guys wanted to introduce yourselves to each other so we all just kind of know who's on the call together. And then we'll get into a little bit more of the Q &A, just trying to learn a little bit more, Ryan, about some of that information that you're sharing, get a little bit deeper into it. And then I'll present a little bit about who we are and how there might be an opportunity to work together towards your objectives. 

1:27 | Ryan
Right. So yeah, so my name is, Ryan Moore. I'm the National Director of Sales Enablement. I operate OSL operations within the US. Sales Enablement is kind of a misnomer for us. It's less about Well, it's part marketing, part, you know, part data, part, you know, training is all of those things. But there's a big heaping amount of strategy that's involved. And we set kind of business development usage cases based on what I do. We in the US, we have approximately 3,000 employees in one program. And then we have a bunch of splinter programs, about 300 to 400 people each in those overall with like OSL between Our operations in Canada and the United States, we've got 7,000 employees. 

2:20 | Anna
Perfect. Thanks, Ryan. Really great to meet you as well. So my name is Anna Pegram. I'm the business development director for North America at Hive Learning. So in terms of sort of what I'm looking at is really at the moment, I'm kind of doing two things. I'm listening to people like yourself actually to kind of learn what are some of those challenges that people in sales enablement are facing at the moment. I feel like Based on the conversations I've had over the last three, three or four months, so much is changing in the markets that teams are having to respond to that sales enablement have got quite a tall ask when it comes to actually equipping their teams to sell effectively right now. So there's a lot of kind of learning and listening and understanding how that feeds back into our product development, which is kind of why I'm here and why I hop into quite a few of these calls. But Charlie will very much be leading the conversation today. I work very closely with Charlie, and I've been here at Hive about six and a half years. Prior to that, I worked in strategy and innovation, looking at some similar sort of change strategies, but on a broader scale, across actually property development, so slightly different industry, in terms of what I was doing before. But definitely, I think that need for change is where my passion has always been. Not from the US, as you can tell from my accent, originally from UK, where our headquarters is based. And I moved to North America about five and a half years ago. And I now live down here in Florida, just on the other coast of Charlie. Okay. Where in the UK are you from? London, so nowhere too exciting, I feel like. 

3:47 | Ryan
I used to live in Twickenham, right outside of Richmond. 

3:52 | Anna
Oh, nice. I was in Hammersmith, so not too far away. How long ago were you there? 

4:00 | Ryan
That was, 2002 to 2006. 

4:04 | Anna
Okay, yeah, so a little while ago, but, yeah, Richmond's a beautiful area. 

4:09 | Ryan
Don't remind me how old I am. I get it. 

4:14 | Anna
That was not my, what I intended by it. But Hammersmith in particular has changed a lot in that time. It was not the nicest of places in the early 2000. And actually it's become quite a nice place recently. So that was more where my thinking was. 

4:30 | Ryan
Well, I mean, okay. Well, I'm in. I still feel judged, but I'm in. 

4:35 | Charlie
Well, Ryan, I hope we can turn that around then. Awesome. So, to kick off, Ryan, I'd love to dig into a little bit more of, the weeds and, the nitty gritty around the use case that you kind of presented to me and what you were noodling on to, bring some of that, innovation to the sales enablement process. You shared with me about having like a CRM style approach to your sales coaching, your sales training, treating all of your associates like, individual clients and making sure that they're getting, the up to date training and being able to track the data on that effectiveness of the training, would love to, give you an opportunity to expand a little bit on that, both for Anna's, benefit as obviously she wasn't on our call, with us the other day, but also for my benefit. So I can start getting a more holistic picture when I haven't, you know, totally ambushed you with a cold call like I did the other day. 

5:31 | Ryan
Okay. So arguably, coaching and coaching development in any kind of like a set, I guess, sales kind of environment is genuinely kind of fractured and broken based on experience. And I don't mean the experience of the, in the, you know, the individual, I mean, the overall experience that, that fragmentation, is usually like, you know, hmm. Creating task oriented, you know, like, learnings that are going to breeze through, a random bunch of topics, compliance, you know, like CP and I, or whatever, what have you. And they end up being, these uncomfortable kind of modules that don't necessarily dictate core behaviors, or fundamental strategies to be able to execute at a higher level. Yeah. You know, and so a lot of sales training that you get is, you know, understand your customer's name. This is when you're checking in, these task oriented things that don't allow, like through the creativity of the individual to breathe, nor does it create any kind of, answer to like a symptomatic problem. Usually they are kind of like a cookie cutter and, you know, quite honestly, like you can see behind me, I've got like It's probably blurred out, but these are bits and pieces of our sales process, you know, like, you know, immortalized in, you know, poster frames, but on, that kind of, that kind of break isn't necessarily personal and nor is it necessarily data driven. And, you know, that, that's problem number one. So the learning experience is awful, you know, it doesn't matter what industry it is. It really, truly doesn't, you know, it's a bunch of scoring files, self paced learning. It could be, ILT, that experience is not tailored to the individual, from like a kind of a training and coaching kind of perspective. And, you know, that is just, that's the reality of scale. Oftentimes we're going to ask, it doesn't matter if you're going to be at, you know, a manager of a boots pharmacy, or, you know, you're going to be like, you know, like a district manager for my organization, or you're going to whatever the organization, whatever it is. that, the ability to scale that information is dedicated, dictated by like the leader actually presenting that information. And quite honestly, that's going to be path of least resistance. The analog that I would love to be able to like achieve and, where I'm thinking the CRM kind of environment, plus some other things we'll go to the, why I think CRM is, it needs to be tailored to the individual, from a capacity in which can be like isolated and highlighted and be able to like direct that in a powerful way. And also being able to keep track of that. Oftentimes like, a coaching software, like currently we use IntelliHR. I don't know if you guys are familiar with, my, what we use, with IntelliHR, but IntelliHR is script driven. it depends on the skill level of the, the executor, the person who's doing the coaching to be able to facilitate anything with quality and doesn't use data or insights to be able to drive that. And so it ends up being fairly mundane, universal carbon copy, you know, and it's in basically they'll only coach, whatever hot button issue I'm complaining or barking about. All of a sudden we'll have a spike in like, a spike in like processing of coaching and, very little effectiveness. And so the effectiveness term is really where I'm seeing CRM, like a CRM based kind of like consult being immensely valuable because the, the, because the difference between CRM and how you would treat a client is like way different than how a lot of people view coaching. Like, coaching is this, lagging indicator, you know, like, a kind of response to, to an event rather than any kind of proactive tool that you can use. CRM is different. How many checkpoints are there? What's the timeline? What's, what's the decay rate of the individual? You know, how long has it been since, we've touched them. And CRMs also drive in an immense amount of data that, drives a transaction. It, you know, you get to surface through API hooks, what possible pain points are, be able to develop that and then be able to transcribe, we've been trying to do algorithmically to dictate what we should be able to talk about. And then being able to procedurally generate, you know, kind of like what that next step is. And the problem is in coaching, it is never a next step, in a retail environment or a sales environment. It's usually like, here's your coaching, go do it. You didn't do it. Let's go, go over it again. Let's go over it again. Let's go over it again. the CRM, you know, is client. It's, it's, you know, it's selling to the, selling to the individual, but makes that proactive response. The data gets surfaced, it gets pushed automatically. This is what you need to go do. What's your contact ratio looking like? But then that, that's the third part of that. And I apologize for being a little bit chaotic. It's been a whirlwind of a morning. The third part of that is the data analytics tools. Most of the, like the HR intelligence software, you know, like that's out on the market or coaching software that you really see, is still a push dynamic, like rather than like a pull dynamic. And It requires a particular level of observation in order to procedurally, in order to generate any of it. What am I coaching? How am I doing? Like, what am I coaching to? And how am I driving that? And inevitably, in a commission level environment, all that stuff gets jettisoned out the window because it's about how, the person doing the coaching gets compensated. Right? I need you to be here. I need you to do this rather than what is necessary for the individual. So, being able to use data insights, like having like a hooks into like, our data visualization, like, our data storage teams, like we use Domo for data visualization. I've broken down every possible thing in the KPIs from footfalls to traffic, to customer engagements, to failure rates. Everything is mapped out. like in a, really tight, bold kind of capacity, but to be able to yank the various stats that get generated and then take that against some kind of matrix to spit out what you should be talking about as a coach. Check this out. This is where this is. This is where this is. This is where this is. It should be, it should give you do this thing, get better at this. Let's coach this. and then once that's done, a CRM client kind of thing, kind of like ticks by and keeps reminding you, is this done? Is this valuable? Is, it, is it's been achieved? HRIS software across the board, is employee satisfaction kind of driven, like, and that's fine. But in the sales environment, you need positive stimuli to be able to generate that in a good way. So anything that I'm going to want is going to need to have like those three things, like really kind of cooked into. it, how it pushes the, you know, one, how it pushes the actual coach into development, how it uses data to analyze and give an expectation of what should be talked about and what should be coached. And then fundamentally, that CRM pull, like, you know, like push dynamic rather than pull, like, I'm not pulling it into this experience. I'm getting pushed into it, being told what I should do, when I should do it and how I should do it, how I should check up on it. you need to master those three things. And then I'm, very interested. It doesn't do one of them. I'm not. 

13:58 | Charlie
Gotcha. And what is the current state, of play at OSLRS kind of look like in delivering those types of things? I know it's not the perfect state, like you're describing right now, but what does that lifestyle and that reality kind of look like today? 

14:15 | Ryan
Like I already told you, we use, IntelliHR for our HRIS kind of software. I have a data analytics that show me the volume of coaching. I have a very difficult way of analyzing the quality of said coaching. I mean, it is very, like, I can't qualitatively, like, I think the most qualitative thing I can do is pull a word cloud, of keywords that, are being used in coachings. And we do not have, because of the lack of linking some data, in the quality hooks to that measuring effectiveness of coaching is limited. Gotcha. I mean, we can see a general kind of thing. Oh, you've been coached. We can dig into, see the quality and then, we can compare and contrast before and after, but all of those things are all still lagging, right? Like, so you're, you would only need to, you'd only be able to see any kind of positive or negative movement, in retrospect rather than progressively. 

15:17 | Charlie
So it sounds like your target audience right now would be, how do you upscale those sales coaches to achieve those three deliverables that you're talking about? The. 

15:25 | Ryan
Well, I need a tool that would seamlessly create an environment in which that is the natural usage case. Gotcha. Inevitably human nature is going to go the path of least resistance. I mean, what Bill Gates said it, said it, said it best. I'm going to give a lazy person a hard job because they'll find the easiest way to do it. 

15:45 | Charlie
I. 

15:47 | Ryan
need it to be so seamless that it's easy. And I will tell you that, you spot, you talked to me, you had some AI stuff and it was interesting. I've been like, like marching with our development team and I've been like looking and slowly been building, trying to build something in house that does those three things, because what we do now is kind of. 

16:15 | Ryan
it works from a kind of like a check the box kind of scenario, but it is not necessarily, it's not necessarily the output that we want or need as an organization. 

16:27 | Charlie
Gotcha. Cool. Anna, before we move on, do you have any questions for Ryan? 

16:34 | Anna
Not right now. But if that changes, I'll definitely let you know as we go through, because I imagine, we'll sort of cover off a, few points anyway, through the conversation. 

16:41 | Ryan
Well, here, let me ask you both of you this question. Am I the only person that is thinking about it in this capacity? 

16:47 | Charlie
No, I would, I wouldn't say that. Definitely the focus on the data availability and the data reporting on how effective is the training program has been key, not only in our sales enablement side of things, but also in our general L and D and talent development aspect of, what Hive does. And definitely not in the ease, the flow of work, the pulling, like trying to create that area of that gamification so that people feel like they want to come in and do the learning. They feel like they're being dragged into it rather than constantly being pushed towards it. You're certainly not alone, in those aspects. And, and I know you've had some other, conversations around similar topics. So if you've got some insights that let Ryan know that he's not alone, you know, I'll give you a moment to. 

17:35 | Ryan
like, do you guys feel like gamification is kind of like this, like, quack kind of buzzword kind of thing, across multiple sales, different fronts, like, and, it's like, we've gamified everything. We've tried, we've tried the buzzword, buzzwordy kind of thing to gamify the entire experience, but I mean, in a sales environment, especially a commission sales environment, I mean, no matter what, if it's fun or if it's boring or if it's intense or if it's right, or if it's smart or it doesn't matter, like you inherently push yourself into people, whether it's the coach or the coachee, you're pushing them to go do something when they inevitably will have a scarcity mindset because it's not necessarily inherently value driven, like, and quite honestly, gamification, while it may be kind of like annoying or fun or whatever. And to me, like any of our gamification stuff has not generated any positive movements. I mean, our most positive movements is me spending an obtuse amount of money with ILT and like side by side like trainers flying around across the country. And quite honestly, I'm assuming our booking agent likes to be busy. And I'm assuming our finance people do not like to look at what I'm spending. 

18:50 | Anna
I... 

18:52 | Charlie
Keep smiling. I'll let you chime in. 

18:54 | Anna
Yeah, I think the gamification piece, is true. It's gamification. Like for me, the difference is gamification for the point of making something fun. It's like jazz hands, right? It's like, 

19:05 | Ryan
cool it's a nice coat of paint great. 

19:06 | Anna
Yeah, but I think what we see works is tapping into more of that intrinsic motivation, which gamification sometimes tries to do, but I think gets wrong a lot of the time. So I think it's similar to like actually in sales. And I can't remember where I read this. I will, if you want the source, I'll find it and send it to you. But looking at the motivation of salespeople and actually they were looking at if you gave them an incentive of five dollars or 500 dollars, you actually got a similar amount of effort put in just to win. And that competitive nature, I think the sort of social motivation of I want to do better than my peers in a sales world is one of the really sort of powerful factors. So creating visibility of what other people are doing is one of the tactics that we start to use so that you can sort of learn from each other, see what others are doing. Benefit from where you've got some of those top reps, you know, I think most people we've spoken to, and I don't know if this is true for you as well, Ryan, I'd be super interested, but is that I have like 10 percent of their sales team that perform really well. They have about 60 percent that support that perform averagely. Then they got about 20 to 30 percent that they're constantly recycling because they're just really underperforming. So actually, how do you how do you create more of that consistency and tap into that 10 percent knowledge effectively in a way that makes 60 percent that are movable shift in the right direction? So those are the sorts of things that we're thinking. about it. And I think your first question around the push pull piece, like sales folk are actually really bad learners. And that hurts me to say as a salesperson, it cut me deep to sort of come to that realization. But we are actually quite bad learners because we're so focused on execution. We miss the practice side often. And I'm putting myself in that bucket, being on some self discovery journey, shall I say, in the. 

20:56 | Ryan
As well. Yeah. 

20:58 | Anna
Yeah. So I think it's also you can't make it hard for people to engage with. So you were sort of talking about the LMS earlier, the focus on satisfaction versus the focus on. Yeah, so I think it's got to be self serving in nature in a way of like, how do I how do I see the benefit of this right now versus, oh, do this learning thing, which is going to help. Which doesn't have that same pull to it. Yeah. But actually, if you can do the five minute thing before a call that makes that call feel better instantly, that's where we see the traction of actually salespeople want to get involved more. They're not necessarily learning, but they're practicing so that they can execute better right there and then. And I think that's kind of some of the nuances that we're seeing and the differences and kind of where people are starting to shift their focus to in the sales enablement space as well, which feels like it really aligns a slightly different kind of positioning to what you said, but I feel like it really aligned with a lot of what I just heard from you. And that's sort of the focus that we've taken here at Hive as well, based on all of that feedback we've had from more of those forward thinking sort of enablement leaders. 

22:15 | Charlie
So I want to be respectful of your time, Ryan. I know we've only got about six minutes left. So I want to give just a quick overview of who we are and what Hive perform, which is our sales focus side of Hive Learning actually brings to life. And then at the end of that six minutes, as we start to jump off, hopefully we'll be at a point where you can kind of see if there's an opportunity to want to learn more and see a demo and see it under the hood, or if you get enough of a sense that this isn't the right fit for you. Totally fair either way. But hopefully you can see my screen here with just my little laptop kind of scrolling away here. So as I mentioned, we're Hive Learning and our sales focus side of Hive Learning is Hive Perform. Hive Learning we've been around for over 12 years and our focus historically has been on that L &D journey upskilling. How do we meet people in the flow of work to pull them into learning rather than forcing them to get pushed constantly for those tick box exercises and giving them the skills that they need at the right time that they need it. We've recently spun off our Hive Perform focus for sales enablement. which is taking a lot of the same principles of how do we pull people into learning and upscaling, but really dialing it in on the sales side, because there is so much of that, as Anna just mentioned, that output driven focus, rather than that, I'm doing this just because it's good for me and it's good for what I'm supposed to be doing. How do we bring learners that are that output driven focused onto a learning journey and to bring them up to speed for that in an immediate result that they're trying to drive? So if you try to think about it in a gym sort of instance, we're thinking about how are we treating our salespeople like athletes? They need to practice in order to perform at a really high and elite level. Hive Learning side is more of like your gym membership. You're going to go in as you need it. You're going to use the equipment, the material that is there that you know how to use, and you're going to kind of be on your own self pace. an effective way. Whereas Hive Perform is that personal trainer side of things. You're getting the accountability, you're getting the tailored specific focus on the skills that you need to be an effective salesperson. You're getting access to the pieces of information that you need exactly in the moment that you need it so you can practice in a very concise and concentrated fashion. I'm not going to spend too long on this slide because I think we've touched on it quite a bit, especially with Anna's insights that she shared just a moment ago. But these are the three areas of focus that we've heard from some folks like yourself that we've been hearing about. I think that you'd probably resonate with that top one. It's just the lack of right and relevant training and information that's available to sales reps. it just takes too long to get especially new reps up to speed on how are we getting salespeople to actually hit that speed to competence, generating revenue at the bottom line. And I think another to your point, having tools and technology that actually is relevant to salespeople to get them upskilled in the right fashion. Am I right in my assumption on which ones you probably align with most? Is there anything on this slide that you'd like to drill into a little bit further before I start getting into the actual Hive use case? 

25:25 | Ryan
No, honestly, this like, it speaks like the language I've been talking about right down to the analogy of, you know, of like the personal trainer or the personal coach versus kind of going to the gym. I was actually referencing that a couple of weeks ago. I mean, I didn't use a personal trainer. He's a boxing coach, but as it were. 

25:45 | Charlie
As a as a jujitsu player, I know exactly what you're talking about, having that That fighting coach there in your corner is always, super helpful to your point that you mentioned just a moment ago about the obtuse amount of money that you're using on jetting, you know, jet setter mindset of going across the country and providing additional support to your sales team in sales enablement across industries, across, you know, different folks and tools and pieces of the puzzle. Sales enablement spent 4,000,000,000 dollars in 20, 23 alone. And for all of that spend, we're still seeing only 91. Excuse me. We're still seeing 91 percent. So only nine percent of organizations are actually going to hit their sales targets in 20 24. So despite that, enormous amount of money that's being shelled out, we're not seeing the drive to the actual results that sales leaders are looking for. And so this is where Hive actually comes into play and how that starts to come to life. I'm going to start in the middle column here just to show you the and talk through what the Hive tools look like. And then I'll talk to the other two columns just how the cohesive landscape starts to come into play. So Hive's modules are all built on a backbone of Microsoft Azure's AI. end. And being able to deliver our four tools in the flow of the work that your sales folks are doing is what is bringing that kind of pull mindset. We're not asking them to jump off and log on to another platform. We're not asking them to add to another LMS or bolt into another pop up window. We're building these things into where they're already working. So Buzz Curator is our ability to actually onboard and upskill your sales folks. You can tailor your learning content exactly how you want it. You can go in and ask the AI to build you a learning program on the Medpix sales methodology, if that's something that you use and are familiar with. And that type of learning can be broken out into 15 minute segments for your folks to access day in, day out mobile app. Super easy. Buzz Facilitator is our AI coach bot. That's if you've got folks that are out in the field, I know you mentioned you've got some folks going to like Walmart, if they've got a meeting with a Walmart leader, and they need to prep for that call, they can go into Buzz Facilitator and actually have a coached simulated conversation. We can upload your objections, your personas, your battle cards, your pitches, whatever elements of your sales landscape that you have, it gets uploaded into the system. And then Buzz Facilitator will actually walk through a role play with your sales folks. You can do it right on your phone. It happens right in Slack or Teams, whichever comms tool that you're using at OSLRS, they can access it right where they're at and get that immediate feedback from the AI about what they did well, where do they still need to improve and give them that pre call practice that is super important to Anna's point about practicing like an athlete. Buzz Sidekick operates similarly in that it is accessible on your slack, your teams, whatever comes to they're already working on. But in this one, it's a content surfacing type of material. So if you've got updated compliance material, I know you mentioned compliance is one of the areas that you're thinking about it. 

29:09 | Ryan
Oh, it's one of the things that I'm not considering. 

29:13 | Charlie
My apologies. I'm glad you clarified that because I was going to go. 

29:18 | Ryan
through it. Learning, adult learning theory states that there has to be some WIFM component into, you know, into anything that they do. And objectively, it needs to have a way of seeing direct in almost near instantaneous kind of benefit for somebody to have any practical application or they're going to rely on like they're all trusted behaviors. They've either A, previously learned or B, you know, feel like they have some level of success. And if you're going to go through change management, especially at the granular level, that WIFM component needs to become front and center. Right. 

29:53 | Charlie
Yeah. And that speaks to and that resonates, I know, internally with Anna and I, with our former Hive Learning hats on of focusing on that adult learning theory. We baked adult learning theory into the AI that we were using for our L &D use case. And so a lot of that still resonates with us as we're trying to work with and help salespeople about making that instantaneous connection for them. And I think Buzz Sidekick bring that brings that to life in that if they're looking for resources, updated materials, promotions, things that they're trying to bring to the forefront, but they just don't have the brain space or the time to go into something like a SharePoint or to a Google Drive and search all the various different folders to try to find that one piece of collateral that they were looking for. Buzz Sidekick is able to surface that material, very quickly for them from a vector database that's specific to, in this case, OSLRS. Being able to surface that material that makes them feel like they've got that Swiss Army knife in their pocket. They're ready for any particular situation that might come up. And then I think the point that's going to the piece of the puzzle that will resonate most with you based on our conversation. I know I'm two minutes over. I'm just going to hit this really quickly and then we can take a quick pause. Buzz Insights is our data analysis. So to your point about qualitative analysis, Buzz Insights is able to draw from not only The content or the commenting and the interactions with Buzz Facilitator and Buzz Sidekick, but also any of the commenting and any of the interactions with Buzz Curator and the overall Sales Academy piece. If your salespeople are commenting and sharing and typing in and providing insights from themselves and what they're feeling in the space, Buzz Insights is going to surface that and do a qualitative analysis for you and provide that data in a way that you can actually surface and provide those insights that you were keying in on. And I've really condensed that down. I'm probably doing it an injustice, but I'm trying to be respectful of your calendar and your time. 

31:44 | Ryan
I do. I did have a hard stop at. Yes. So yeah. 

31:47 | Charlie
Is this worth another call? Am I starting to start to scratch the surface of what you. 

31:52 | Ryan
I mean, sure. I would love to see, because I know you have HRIS kind of like inputs. I wanted to replace that. 

32:06 | Charlie
Okay. So you actually want to replace like IntelliHR. 

32:11 | Ryan
The tool as it is that we use IntelliHR for is from a coaching perspective. We don't use it for the compendium of all the other bits and pieces. So I mean, we have like a, like we do, we have like our own backend systems and also that we use for all that stuff. We only use the coaching element for it. So that's really where my brain is at. So if you want to give me more information on, that would be wonderful. I do have to jump because I do have to talk to a couple of VPs.
