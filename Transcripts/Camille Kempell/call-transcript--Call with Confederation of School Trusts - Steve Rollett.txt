Hi, is that Steve Rollett speaking? Hello, this is Camille from Hive Learning. We used to partner with Confederation of Schools Trust. I'm just getting in touch with a few customers. How are you doing? 

0:03 | Steve
It is. 

0:11 | Steve
Yes. 

0:14 | Steve
Yeah, good thank you. Thank you very much. 

0:14 | Camille
Oh, awesome. I was just wondering if you've got a couple of minutes just to share any feedback you had about the partnership with Hive. I've just stepped into the business development role from our accounts team. So just keen to know a little bit about your experience. And then if it's of interest, we'd love to share a bit more about some of the generative AI tools that we've been developing to help speed up learning design and make it more personalised. 

0:20 | Steve
Mm hmm. 

0:42 | Steve
Yeah, sure. So I'm happy to give you. Yeah, I've got a couple of minutes now. I can give you some quick feedback. What with regards to the other stuff, you're probably better off talking to my colleague, Sarah, and I can give you her email address if that's helpful. 

0:48 | Camille
Awesome. Thank you. 

1:00 | Camille
That would be great, thank you. 

1:03 | Steve
Yeah. So, OK, so what sort of feedback is helpful to you? 

1:07 | Camille
I suppose what I'm mostly of interest in is what worked well, what you liked about the partnership with Hyven, anything that didn't work so well and perhaps why the partnership came to an end. 

1:19 | Steve
Yeah, okay. So what worked well, so what worked well, really loved the people. So we had Hugh, who was managing our sort of our relationship. And he was brilliant. Nothing good things to say about him. The platform was good at the point where we started the piece of work that we were doing. But effectively, as the professional communities that we were using it for grew in number, and the task of what we were trying to manage became a little bit more complicated, and the nature of our community sort of shifted, it basically just became the wrong product for us. So, yeah, so that's why it ended. But, yeah, nothing but good things to say about the people and the support that we had, the onboarding, all of that was excellent. 

1:29 | Camille
Yeah. 

1:39 | Camille
Thank you. 

1:56 | Camille
Mm. 

2:00 | Camille
Thank you. 

2:05 | Camille
Okay, yeah. 

2:18 | Camille
yeah that's good to know and when you say it became the wrong product what did you end up replacing hive with that was a benefit for you at the time. 

2:29 | Steve
Yeah, so we ended up going with... Oh, crikey, do you know what? It's like the same name, except not Hive Learning. It's. Hive Bright, yeah. 

2:40 | Camille
it's what sorry yeah. 

2:44 | Camille
and what was it that high bright offered that hive weren't able to. 

2:49 | Steve
yeah so this is why my memory's a bit sketchy but i mean i might want to talk to sarah about some of this but broadly so when we did when we first launched the hive learning platform we had a notion of using it with you know one or two of our i think it's just one initially our professional communities and that It would be a place where people would go to for, I suppose, what feels more like learning materials. And Hive Learning seemed like a really good place for that. As the offer sort of evolved, what we ended up with was, I think we've got sort of eight or nine professional communities now. 

2:56 | Camille
Yeah. 

3:07 | Camille
Thank you. 

3:13 | Camille
Yeah. 

3:23 | Camille
Thank you. 

3:30 | Camille
Yeah. 

3:33 | Camille
Yeah. 

3:39 | Camille
Thank you. 

3:44 | Camille
Thank you. 

3:46 | Steve
We have an offer which is probably less around learning materials and more around, I suppose, a more traditional online community type approach, really. And, yeah, the platform perhaps just wasn't quite right for that, which is not a criticism of the platform. I actually really like what the platform's trying to do. It probably just wasn't quite right for our members and what they were trying to get out of it. 

3:56 | Camille
Thank you. 

4:06 | Camille
Yeah. 

4:11 | Camille
Yeah. 

4:12 | Steve
So that, coupled with I think administering across that range of communities, I think was a bit more straightforward and sort of the back end for Hivebrite. And I think also, I think as the communities grew, it became a bit sort of cost prohibitive because I think the Hive learning to have increased the number of licenses and so on that we needed, it was just, it would have just been too much. So yeah, that's my broad recollection. 

4:19 | Camille
Yeah. 

4:33 | Camille
Thank you. 

4:40 | Camille
Yeah. 

4:43 | Camille
That's really useful. Thank you so much. And yeah, I'll definitely have a little look into Hivebrite. I've not actually heard of them. So yeah, thank you for that. And just your last point now, you mentioned about the licenses. So the licenses model meant it became a challenge to afford. 

4:52 | Steve
Sure. 

5:02 | Steve
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we're not the profit. And there was, I think there was a discount that we got and we had a decent initial sort of agreement and so on. So there's no sort of sense of hard luck or anything like that on our part. But I think the licensing model was just, it wasn't quite right for what we were wanting because what we wanted was just many more licenses booked with users who are probably going to be slightly more casual in their use. 

5:03 | Camille
Yeah. 

5:09 | Camille
Okay. 

5:15 | Camille
Thank you. 

5:20 | Camille
Hmm. 

5:27 | Camille
Yeah. 

5:31 | Camille
Yeah. 

5:36 | Camille
Yes. 

5:37 | Steve
And I don't think the model assumed that. I think the model assumed that we would have more involved, engaged users in it. And that, I guess, somewhere along the line, we would probably be recouping some of that cost from our members. And that just became impossible for us to do at that level. We weren't able to charge our members enough, frankly, to cover the cost of it. 

5:51 | Camille
Okay. 

6:01 | Camille
Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you for the info. And what kind of learning and development needs are there at the moment within the organisation that you're looking to solve? 

6:15 | Steve
So this is partly it. So, I mean, we didn't really use the platform for that. So we used the platform to work with our members and the people that we represent. We didn't really use it as an internal facing thing in the way that I know some of your other organizations did or do. So for us, it was never really about sort of internal development and so on. And that's not what we're using the new platform for either. 

6:18 | Camille
you. 

6:29 | Camille
Yeah. 

6:32 | Camille
Yeah. 

6:41 | Camille
Okay. 

6:45 | Camille
And is that a need for you at the moment, that kind of internal development piece or are you managing that? 

6:50 | Steve
No, not currently. So we're still a reasonably small team and probably something like that would be overcooking it probably for our needs at the moment. 

6:57 | Camille
Yeah. 

7:04 | Camille
Yeah, yeah, no, that makes sense. And then just back to my question around AI. Are you leveraging AI technology at the organisation at the moment? No. 

7:10 | Steve
Yeah. 

7:16 | Steve
Like, intermittently. Again, so we've gone through a huge sort of change as we've grown. So our membership's grown. Our internal capacity struggles to keep up. So in that lovely spot of trying to do, trying to sort of catch up with where we ought to be, in a sense, with our capacity, and trying to find time, knowing that sometimes if you invest in new technologies, new ways of working, you get time back. But also just trying to get to that, some of that stuff is tricky. So AI is not something as yet that we've got into massively. One or two of us in the organization will dabble with things like, you know, chat GPT and stuff like that. But no, not for us in the nature of our work. It's not something that we've really prioritized yet and probably won't do for a couple of years would be my guess. 

7:22 | Camille
Yeah. 

7:37 | Camille
No. 

7:44 | Camille
No. 

8:03 | Camille
Yeah, that makes sense. 

8:09 | Camille
Okay, interesting. Would you, or Sarah even, you mentioned, would you be interested in having just a half an hour demo call as a way to just see what's out there and if it piques your interest and feels like something that could actually save time, maybe we continue the conversations from there? 

8:14 | Steve
Yeah. 

8:27 | Steve
Yeah, so probably not right for me, but if the, I suppose, is this about, so is the AI in relation to Hive Learning or is this a different product? 

8:28 | Camille
Absolutely. 

8:38 | Camille
Yeah, that's right. So essentially, if you imagine them as new AI tools that we've developed that sit either within the Hive platform or alongside it. So there's various ones that we've developed. One of them is designed to help you create learning and training programs within the space of a few minutes, rather than the months that it can usually take. We also then have an AI coach, which gives the users that one to one skills practice space. We can make them really specific, so they could be sort of role play examples. They could be specific to sales or management. Yeah, the world's our oyster really with what they can be about. And then we also have an insights tool that helps us turn the hive data and the very rich data platform that we've got into insights and so it will let us know about the skills gaps that maybe still remain following a training program or even part way through what are the skills gaps that we need to address and then we also we've just developed a brand new tool which integrates with various other points within your tech stack so integrate with you know, whether you use Teams or Google Drive or SharePoint. And so it becomes a very informed version of ChatGPT. So where you would get a generic answer from ChatGPT, get a much more specific answer from Sidekiq because it's connected to various parts in the tech stack that you have. 

8:50 | Steve
Yeah. 

9:41 | Steve
Okay. 

10:00 | Steve
Yeah, yeah. 

10:08 | Steve
Okay. So that's an interesting one. Have you got anything you can send me by email that I can then share internally and ask people if they're interested? Because what I'm mindful of is capacity issues. This probably doesn't, what you're describing probably doesn't sit actually with our communities stuff, I think, which is what Sarah manages, which is where the Hive Learning Product was. This sounds like if it's going to appeal to anyone in the organisation... possibly more in our professional development services but I'm not quite sure that they've got the capacity at the moment to do much with it but if you can send it by email I'm happy to share it internally and then if people want to reach out to you they can get in touch. 

10:22 | Camille
Yeah of course. 

10:28 | Camille
Mm. 

10:34 | Camille
Yeah. 

10:41 | Camille
Yeah. 

10:50 | Camille
Thank you. 

10:57 | Camille
Yeah, awesome. The email that I've got for you is s rollett. at cstuk org. uk.. Is that the right one? Awesome. 

11:03 | Steve
That's it. Perfect. Yeah, yeah. Please bring it over. Yeah, and I'll share that internally. If anyone's interested, then I'll get in touch with you. 

11:10 | Camille
That's brilliant. Thanks so much, Steve. It's been really great to connect with you. Did you have any questions for me before I leave you alone? 

11:19 | Steve
No, no, that's all good. 

11:21 | Camille
Awesome. Well, thank you so much. It's been a pleasure to speak to you. Enjoy the rest of your day. 

11:24 | Steve
That's okay. You too. Thanks very much. Cheers. Thanks. Bye. 

11:27 | Camille
Thanks so much. Take care. Bye.
