function and then just share that recording back with you afterwards as well. 

0:04 | Ball
America. 

0:06 | Rowena
And actually, while we're waiting for some other team members to join. Oh, there we go. We've got Gary. It's been a while since I've spoken to Gary. 

0:15 | Ball
Hi there, Gary. All right, way to go. 

0:20 | Rowena
Perfect, got a few more. Looks like not causing too many issues, hopefully. 

0:25 | Ball
Excellent. 

0:27 | Rowena
Hi, Claire. Hi, Stuart. 

0:30 | Ball
Hi, how are you? 

0:32 | Rowena
Good, thank you. I think first time maybe meeting Stuart and Claire, so nice to meet you both, virtually, and Gary, I've spoken a few times. I think we're waiting for a few more people, just while we're waiting, I know Mike, you will have heard this last time, can do very quick intros just on either side, just while we're waiting for some more people to join, so Hi, I'm Rowena. I'm the partnership director for the Barclays account here at Hive and joined today by Dan. So Dan, I'll let you do your intro and also Kish who's just joined from listening capacity because he's new to the team. So keen to just join along and listen to one of our workshops on Buzz Curator. So yeah, that's the high side. Dan, do you want to just do a quick hello on your side? 

1:29 | Dan
Yeah, hi again, everyone. Really good to be here. So I work in the learning experience team at Hive. Traditionally, we designed the content off the shelf content that we deliver to clients. Now with AI, we're figuring out how best to use it for innovative learning experiences. So that's kind of what I do every day at the moment. 

1:47 | Rowena
Thanks Dan and so I guess as we're running through the workshop as we go through today any questions on the more learning experience design side of things then please do ask Dan those and I'll jump in on kind of general context. Yeah and while we're waiting I think Stuart and Claire I've not met you I think on a call properly yet so it's great to just understand a little bit more about your roles and what you're looking to get out today. 

2:17 | Ball
Yeah, I'll go first. Hi, I'm Claire and my role in this, I am being Scrum Master for kind of the innovation team that we're looking at. Again, what can we do with AI? What tools are out there? How can we potentially best utilise them within the talent function? So we're running a number of different agile sprints to look at those and look at what we could potentially use. So that's kind of why I'm here is to understand what it is that your tools can offer and how could we potentially look to utilise those? 

2:52 | Rowena
Great. Thanks, Claire. That's really helpful. And hi to those who just joined. We're just doing some quick intros for those who didn't join the call last week, just so I know everyone's roles and what they're hoping to get out of the session. 

3:07 | Ball
I'll jump in. My name's Stuart, as you can see. I'm a people leader in Mike's team. So I look after a team of designers who look after our mandatory training calendar throughout the year, etc. So it's quite a heavy number of modules that go out each quarter. There's about 160 over the year currently at the moment. I think like Claire said, perhaps as you mentioned last week, so we've been supporting each other in terms of the sprint, in terms of AI, and we've got Nick who works in my team and for Mike also has been really busy testing content and AI content. So just been really supporting him actually in the last couple of weeks I've been on holiday, which has been great. But before that, we've been helping Nick testing and looking and supporting him with the AI creation. So it's really good to see what's available today. My own knowledge is probably like entry level, so it's really great to meet you guys and just have a little bit more understanding about what you guys do, how you do it, et cetera, and how you potentially can support. 

4:04 | Rowena
Brilliant, thanks. Gary, I know we've met quite a few times. I think for the purpose of Dan, great to have a little intro and what you're hoping to get out today. Thank you. 

4:14 | Ball
yeah thanks really yeah i am i work in the ux design team here at barkley so i help create some of the learning experiences some of the learning portals where you just can you can find my learning and i'm working with mike stew and claire on the ai sprints and how we can how we can use some ai technology to help with some of our ux processes and create ultimately better journeys for our brokers for our customers and for our colleagues and provide them with learning their needs. 

4:50 | Rowena
Great. Thanks, Gary. So I think the only person who we haven't had an intro from last week or this week is Josie. So nice to meet you. If you're happy to just jump on and tell us a little bit about your role. Thank you. 

5:04 | Ball
Hi, Rowena. Yes, very nice to meet you all. And apologies, I wasn't able to join last week. So I've been working closely with Joan, with Mike's team as well, on this very initial exploratory use case that we have been doing on the Gen AI space. I work in a people analytics team, and I support a team of organizational psychologists and data scientists. And we have been actually sort of, we are actually helping different parts of HR to actually sort of get through the journey of using the tools that the bank is actually bringing in terms of Copilot or Copilot Studio into the organization. 

5:51 | Rowena
Brilliant. Thank you very much. And yeah, thanks for joining again, John and Mike. I think we can spare you doing an intro again as you were on the calls last week. And just from our side, it's myself, Dan, who you met last week. And we've got Kish who's joined us today just from a listening capacity, just as he's new to the team. So in case you're wondering about who's joined on Hive's side. So today what we thought we would cover is an introduction to our Buzz Curator, which is our learning sprint creation tool. I can show you a demo of that tool. We can talk through how it works in practice. While I'm doing that, please feel free to ask any questions, particularly around how the tool works, but also the learning design experience behind it. And Dan can also talk through that. Dan will also add some more context after I've done. 

6:49 | Rowena
on the learning experience design behind the Buzz Curator tool. And then we thought we'd use the rest of the session to do a little bit of an interactive get started on Buzz Curator. So you should have all received an invite over the last week or two to join a sandbox group on the Barclays Hive environment. At the end of the session, I'll share another link. Just make sure that you're all onto the system We'll get you all starting to test out the tool and build your own sprints. You can ask us any questions as you're doing that, and then we'll leave you to be able to play around with that after the call. But hopefully after today's call, you should feel really confident in going away and having a go at creating some sprints and testing out on your side of things as well. Is there anything else that anyone was hoping to cover today that you'd like me to add into the agenda? Or does that feel like it fits what you were hoping to cover? 

7:51 | Ball
No, I think that's fine. Probably just one sort of note which might help with it as well. So obviously what we're hoping for here is to be testing this as part alongside the other sort of potential AI tools as something that we bring into our processes in the future. And so the level, everyone that we're planning to use this is already a pretty experienced learning designer, if that makes sense. So the level at which I guess you're positioning this, it can be sort of a bit more of an expert level rather than sort of say like a stakeholder in barclays who might be creating learning from scratch. We'd be expecting the people in our team anyway who'd be using this to be people who are, you know, they are learning designers already. I don't know if that's helpful or not, but basically we're not looking for a kind of a beginner level product for us to be using. Not to say that wouldn't be something the bank might use in the future, but for our purposes it's actually just sort of trying to achieve some specific goals. 

8:51 | Rowena
Yeah, no, that's great. Thanks, Mike. And I think while Dan is talking through some of the learning experience design side of things and what's customisable for Barclays, I think that's probably something that will be really useful for us to touch upon so that we can add that extra layer of detail for you. 

9:08 | Ball
Can I just want one thing from my perspective would be we're also focusing our thoughts on augmentation initially rather than full automation of our design processes. So, you know, we still we want to work out where that point is because we've got very skilled designers. You know, how do we work alongside the technology? So it might be that we're not taking full package modules out of something like a high curate you know buzz creator tool so i just wanted to understand how you're working around that as we go through. 

9:47 | Rowena
Yeah, perfect. 

9:51 | Ball
Maybe he's going to answer my question. 

9:52 | Dan
I think it's such a complex nuanced question and I think the whole session will be really good to frame the answer as talking through that. But I just wanted to say how relatable that you've both mentioned is, especially my team, we've been trying to figure out how we use AI in our workflows and perhaps not necessarily replacing us entirely, but figuring out how we augment our own abilities to design what we know to be great learning content with the capacity that AI currently has. So as we go through, I'll let Rowena talk you through the model, but yeah, we can definitely dig into that. And we've got lots of experiences and insights to share on that particular question. 

10:30 | Rowena
Great. Perfect. Thanks, Sam. Let me get the right window up here. Perfect. So what I'll do is I'll start by just setting the scene with the Buzz Curator tool. I know some of you have seen this before, but I will highlight some of the new features that we've recently added and show you how it works so that when we give you access, which you should have from today's session, it means that you know how it will work and how you can get the most out of it. So I've invited you to the Barclays GenAI tools sandbox group. For those of you who were on the session last week as well, you'll be able to access some of the Buzz facilitator scenarios that we've added in there. So you can have a play around with those and we can also create some more for you. When it comes to actually creating a sprint using the Buzz curator tool, you need to go to the left hand menu here and click on sprints. And then you go for the option of create new sprint and then select the with buzz option. So this is the one where we'll use AI to generate it for you. And then as it loads, we'll have two options here, one to create a sprint with a document that you've uploaded, or we can just start creating the sprint. So if I start creating, I can either choose to upload that document that I want to base the sprint off. For the purpose of this demo, I've just actually selected one from online, open available on the web, just about the Barclays way. But this is a secure environment within our Azure environment, so you can upload any documents that you would share with us normally via SharePoint or normal file sharing. It does normally take a little bit of time to process and load, so that's just worth bearing in mind when you're building your own sprint that you'll need to leave it for a few minutes so that it just processes and then it lets you know when it's ready. I'm going to switch windows. Dan, give me a nod if it's switched over to the new one. It has, good. I've uploaded a document here already so that we can then continue without waiting for that other document to upload. But it's just the same document that I've used. So if I then continue with Buzz Curator, it should take in that document that I've just uploaded into the system we can add multiple as well some of the ways in which we've done that is we've also taken transcripts of interviews we've done with colleagues across the business and then turn learning sprints out of it so there's a whole host of ways that you can use that context dan will also talk about what we can do to slightly personalize this for barclays so we know about your values, we know about the type of personas we're working with, if it's people leaders, assistant vice presidents, we've got certain types of behaviours that we want to see across those colleagues so we can then personalise that learning to those personas as well. So here we can get started with creating the learning sprint. It will, as we start building out the learning sprint, it will start to populate on the workspace area on the right hand side. So you can then see how it's evolving. Just to save when it comes to typing. I've actually just written out some answers here of how I would like to guide the creation of this learning sprint. So in this example, I've said this learning sprints for new graduates recently hired. They should cover a summary of the existing values, respect, integrity, service, excellence. stewardship also cover the mindset and then use the information in the document but also add some extra context to really bring it to life so that hopefully it starts building that out for us we'll then have a conversation backwards and forwards with the buzz curator tool so we can really refine exactly what we want to include in that sprint so you can see here it's already started building out the overall sprint objectives which we can check make sure that it feels like it is covering everything that we want it to the sprint audience the sprint background the context and the cadence so here you can see it's already started building out the pathway titles and you can see it's broken down that mindset one into three different pathways but i think we probably just want to have that as one so we can then you know ask the tool to edit the pathways and go in and make some changes until we feel like it's a stage that we're ready at that we're ready to produce the learning sprint as a result of it the more context we give at this stage the more detailed it will be and the better the results will turn out so if I then say I'd like the pathway titles to be and what we'll probably do is shortcut this one so that We don't go through the full chat that it would normally guide you through because that can take a little bit longer. But we would normally keep engaging in this chat until we're really feeling like we're in a comfortable space to be able to create the sprint. And as you can see, once I start making those changes, it starts updating as we go through. And I can make any further changes here. out extra detail but in this case it's jumped straight ahead because I've given quite solid information just as to what I want and I've not asked for any changes so if I jump through and say view sprint plan generation this is where I'll get to see the pathways that it's building out and it's just loading up those pathways now so the second one will be embodying the value of respect and as the content is being created, those four cards that stick within that pathway will start being created. While it's working away in the background, we'll talk through some of the kind of main ways that we can use this. So obviously you've mentioned that as a team, you're looking for a much more kind of expert level of how you could use a tool like this. I'll let Dan talk to some of those kind of elements that we can customize. in a minute but some of the ways in which the teams that are using this tool are doing it is they might sit with an sme in the business and they might go through that together that initial chat start building out that conversation using specific documents that they've got internally and then they'll use that to create that sprint together other scenarios that we've done as i mentioned as we were going through it dan and i worked on one together where we interviewed a risk leader across the business and built out a specific risk mindset pathway around content that didn't previously exist across the organisation. So we recorded a transcript of that interview, we fed that through the system and then we really prompt and engineered that so that it then produced a learning sprint as a result of the conversation that we had with that client. As you can see, it's just building out while I'm talking through that. And I should be able to shortcut it as it's got a button here now to just go to my sprint. But I always recommend you wait for it to fully complete before you click through. Just for the purpose of this demo, I think I can cut ahead just for speed purposes. So once I load through, you can see it's still creating that sprint. And once some of it's ready, it will just start showing up in my sprint manager. And I can always jump to one I have created earlier if it helps save time. But while I'm doing that and it's just loading, Dan, do you want to talk through some of the kind of customisable elements that we've thought about from a learning experience design element that might help with properties? I'd like to look at this. 

18:46 | Dan
Yeah, just before we do that, I see you've got your hand up, Mike. 

18:49 | Rowena
Oh, sorry. 

18:51 | Dan
You might be on mute still. 

18:53 | Ball
Sorry, you might be about to answer this, Dan, but I think in the testing we've done so far with other tools, our use cases where we've broken them down into much smaller tasks, if that makes sense, all sort of part of creating a larger learning module or sort of curriculum or something. Would it be possible to do things like that in Hive, or does it all basically, is the output always a full sprint, or could you do certain... For instance, one of our use cases is taking... a piece of learning, say, sort of module, and then creating the test questions afterwards, which we use to test people on. And that's kind of the sum of what we're trying to achieve in one use case, rather than building the whole thing each time. 

19:31 | Dan
Yeah, that workspace is very kind of customizable. So as to how much control we want to give learning designers, that's quite open for discussion, I think. What I wanted to quickly show you, just to sort of add to this conversation, is the experience that my team has behind the scenes. we've tackled that question for the last year as to how much automation we want versus how much automation we don't we've had lots of different feedback from clients some of who say we want our learning designers to have more time to think creatively about the whole learning experience so they're not too fussed about the sort of detailed parts of the courses they're building so they might not want to have as much control over where to place questions and so forth but we've had the exact opposite feedback before as well and i'd love to get your take on this but just show you how we've adjusted it so this is buzz labs this is kind of our behind the scenes tool which allows us to test and iterate all the things you've just seen with buzz curator and this is a version that we call buzz curator pro which is specifically for my team because we felt we wanted a bit more hands on control so you can see here we have the same kind of parameters the title of the sprint the learning objectives and so forth but we've actually added an extra stage where our team can adjust the sprint plan, whereas BuzzCurator currently automates that for you, we've been exploring how much control we want to give the learners. So here, for example, it's gone into detail on what each card looks like, the kind of things that will be in those cards. So here it's suggesting we might have some information around a video, a quiz block, for example, to your point, Mike. So we can customize that here behind the scenes for our team. And in terms of Buzz Curator, if I was to just go into one that I was building yesterday, that workspace is, again, very customizable. So if at this stage a learning designer said, actually, I just want you to create me one pathway or one card with just quizzes, they can do that. at the moment these are a bit fixed in place in the sense that we've defined these parameters like sprint audience print background and so forth but we can add new elements to those for example turn a voice give more control over what kind of learning design we call them blocks at the hive so like quiz block poll block video block and so forth so yeah that's something we're exploring right now but if that's what you need then i think that's what we can deliver. 

21:42 | Rowena
Yeah thanks Dan and I think it's really interesting talking to a learning design team about this because on the client side because often we're talking to more on the L &D side they want to be able to fast forward their creation process so actually some of the tools that Dan's using behind the scenes might actually be more interesting to you if you're looking at specific scenarios of types of content that you're trying to create that for instance like making a quiz out of some of the original content that you're creating. Dan, was there anything else you wanted to touch on now? Or I can jump in and show what's created as. 

22:24 | Dan
Yeah. One thing I do want to get to, but Mike, have you still got your hand up for a follow up question? No worries, I just love questions and do let us know when you're looking at these things, what you think that does well and what you wish it would do differently. Let me just go back into the buzz curator that I built the other day. So just testing this tool, we've covered it from a couple of different angles and the way that it creates content right now is very much in line with the hive way of doing things. So we traditionally think of a sprint as being a four week learning experience. and we tend to go for apologies again if you're not familiar with the hive vernacular but we talk in sprints pathways and cards so we've set out a system where we have a four week kind of learning experience and each week has a pathway which is about 15 minutes worth of learning and then we break those down into cards which are about two three minutes of small bite sized learning. 

23:21 | Dan
And that's what this model is trained on. But we can obviously change that just in the prompting behind the scenes. We can ask it to do different things. And a learning designer, even within this buzz chat and this workspace, can change that itself. For example, sprint cadence, that will ultimately adjust what's going on behind the scenes and pathway title similarly. And we can add extra kind of parameters that you feel your learning designers want to define into here. So that's quite easy to empower your designers however you like. But there's other novel things we've been doing behind the scenes. So this version, the group that you've got here, the Barclays Jenny Eye Tools Sandbox Group, is an experiment which has worked quite well, where we fine tuned a model not to learn from our kind of off the shelf catalog. So it's not learning about how we write. It's learning about how we lay out cards. So our cards, like I mentioned, consist of blocks. So there's blocks of text. There's blocks with polls. There's blocks with quizzes, videos, and so forth. More recently, If you were in the session last week, you would have known we've got what we call chat blocks, which are governed by our Buzz facilitator tool, which is an AI interactive kind of scenario driven learning experience. And although this version doesn't work with Buzz facilitator yet, we have experimented with and got it to work so that we've trained Buzz basically on how we've designed cards at scale. And we function that model to replicate that. So it's actually got a bit more learning experience. Of philosophy in it, which we've noticed has meant that we don't have to have as much control as and designers into the output because it's already doing things that we want it to do. And I'm fairly confident that's something that we can experiment with. If you have, for example, a corpus of best in class Barclays learning exactly how you want to deliver it within the parameters of those block systems, we could do something quite similar here. So that's a bit more kind of experimental and I'm sure if our head of product Max was here, he'd probably be like, please don't promise that. It's very much a roadmap, tool, but it's the kind of way that I'm thinking about things, which is we want to give learning designers lots of control, but we also want to help them to be more productive and to speed up their work and also potentially to be able to focus their attention away from some of the more day to day tasks like writing at scale, designing cards that sometimes they don't need to, and figuring out more about What's innovative in learning experience? So that sprint model I mentioned that this version of Buzz Curator is defined by, we've almost started to think about how would we redefine that? How would we rethink our sprint model based on all these different tools we have? And that's the most fun part behind the scenes with prompting this tool is that we can start to think differently about what we want to build. And we're hoping to figure out what the right level of autonomy for learning designers at clients like Barclays would be. So if you have any thoughts on that, please let us know, because I'd love to talk through that. But that's pretty much how it works behind the scenes. If anyone has any questions on that, I'm quite happy to. Jose, I see you've got your hand up. 

26:16 | Ball
Daniel, I know this is very exciting and very helpful as well. I mean, it actually feels very flexible, you know, and the way that you are actually sort of building it as well. I mean, it allows to actually sort of pivot into different directions as well. I'm just kind of wondering whether it might be possible, and you might say, look, this is not possible because it's proprietary information, but whether it might be possible to understand for the different elements that you are coming up, like an example, for instance, the cards, the learning cards, one that you actually mentioned, What is the specific knowledge base that you are actually using to actually train your systems? And the reason why I'm actually sort of curious about that is that knowing the knowledge base of what you have actually used allows us perhaps to find the right use case for the specific things we're doing. And also knowing the knowledge base that you are actually using to train might allow us to say, look, is it possible to do exactly the same with that specific knowledge base to be able to do a different use case? 

27:15 | Dan
Yeah, so we tried it two different ways. The version that we started off with was just driven by GPT's knowledge base. So we used GPT for O and the GPT family of AI tools. And what we did was kind of, I hope this makes sense, but zero shot prompting, where we just created the right kind of stable prompt to define all the parameters that we know are important, like tone of voice, the way in which the card would be laid out and so forth. The more recent version and Rowena can correct me if there's a possibility to see this on the Barclays Org. But if you have access to our catalogue of content, you can see the content that we've used to fine tune a model. So you'll see, for example, how we've used quizzes and how we've used all the different tools we have in the platform that anyone can use as an editor. We've trained the model to basically learn from that. So there's nothing I can show you on that as such. But you'll be able to see how our content is now informing what this tool builds. But we've also added a few things in this example in your tool. For example, we're aware that emojis might not be the biggest popular thing at Barclays. We've had a few courses where we've been asked to reduce the number of emojis we use, which is a very high style thing. And I went into this prompt for this particular group that you're testing. and basically took out the instruction to add emojis. So whether we're fine tuning the model or whether we're giving it direct instructions in the prompt itself, it's very flexible. I think there's very little I would say it can't do if you asked me to try and make it to do what you needed it to do, if that makes sense. 

28:46 | Ball
with you. So the first iteration, I would say it's similar to what you get in GPTs, actually, if you actually use, whereas the second iteration is still the kind of GPT kind of example, but with a larger knowledge base that you are actually using to be able to train the system. I wonder actually, sorry, just one follow up question in this case. So in terms of knowledge base, it's quite flexible. In terms of the LLM of the model that is actually behind, of course, you are using for all are you able to actually use a cloud, for instance, any of the cloud models as well, or you are actually just attached to one of the specific sort of models that you're working on? 

29:27 | Dan
It's a great question. We've been testing lots of different ones, and I think it's just subject to the contractual relationship between a client and Hive as to which one we use. But we can safely use quite a few within the Azure family. So we've got access to Claude, but we're just figuring out the terminology and contracts and so forth. But when we actually apply the prompts to different LLMs, we can still even with minor adjustments only, get the right kind of output. And we do notice that there's a difference between the different LLMs. Claude is, very good. I'm sure you've experienced that yourself. So if you find that you're using Claude and you would like us to look into that, we can do that as well. Okay, thank you. 

30:02 | Rowena
Yeah, I'd be interested to know if there's a preference on Barclay's side and if there's a reason for the question. We can then pick up with our product team. So I had a product who was on the call last week, Max, and talk about what the possibilities are. So, yeah, I'd be interested to know if there's a reason I clawed over GPT. 

30:25 | Ball
I think at the moment, Rowena, I think it's more around the accuracy of the model itself. I mean, we have actually sort of found that the cloth, I mean, especially the latest version, the three point five. So it's really good when it comes to actually more kind of inferential kind of cases there. And the potentially the kind of prompting required for that is actually sort of it forgives you. in terms of the prompts that you can actually use as well, because it's actually sort of catering for that. I think going forward in terms of the kind of strategy for the bank, I mean, of course, we are actually following sort of when it comes to ready made tools that users can actually use, I think we're going down the route of Microsoft in terms of the co pilot family to potentially models that analysts would have access to. We are actually going potentially at least to start with, I don't know how it's going to be in the next six months, through the Amazon Bedrock route. And with Amazon Bedrock, of course, Cloud actually comes as part of the kind of key sort of models there. So that's actually where we're going in terms of the kind of strategy right now. But again, in six months, it will look completely different perhaps. 

31:41 | Rowena
Yeah, no, I completely understand and thanks for sharing that. I think it's helpful for us when we raise it with Max because I think Barclays for us are obviously really a key customer. We're really keen to create something that works for you and your team. If it needs a conversation with our product team about seeing the equivalent of doing this with Claude, then we're open to having that conversation and having as much detail before I talk to Max about it as possible is really helpful. 

32:11 | Dan
And one extra thing, Rowena, before I forget, just in case you were going in this direction, Jose, with your question, this particular version of BuzzCurator also uses a vector database. So the knowledge is being augmented by the documents that you upload. So we have a whole system in place for analyzing those documents and being able to extract that information when every single card is built. So you'll notice, I don't know if you've got the sprint built, Rowena, but the one that Rowena just showed us at the start should have lots of Barclays infused information in there from the documents that she uploaded.

Thank you. Let me let me jump back in, actually, and I can show you. So it has now created you can see here all of the different pathways and each of the cards that's been included. If I then click through and go through to my sprint, hopefully this time I've given it enough time to load now. So it should come through in a second. There we go. You can see here it's broken it down into a week by week rollout. This is where we've set this up so that someone who is a learning and development professional can then roll this out really quickly and easily at touch button. I know at Barclays we run a lot of cohorts of learners, so you can set this up to run across a single cohort and then replicate it and run it out across multiple at scale. You can then make all the changes you need to the order and the structure of the pathways just by dragging it around. So it's really easy to use. I can add in any of the nudges that we use to drive communications here at Hive. So those are the tags and the comments, which normally tag the group or an individual, and then it can draw people back into the conversations that are taking place on the platform. So here I can tag to that first pathway and that first card. And then I would just say that group. And I'm just going to write test there. But if I can then schedule it, zero days after the first resource is published at nine o 'clock, you have a lot of different functionalities here. We also have the ability to ghost post on behalf of other admin members, which is something that we use quite often across our communications at Hive so if I was then to save that it will come up in that timeline across the top and I can move it around as needed it will appear in just a couple of minutes. If I want to jump in and show you quickly what's been created when it comes to the cards I'll jump into that first card and you can see here in this version of Buzz Curator that we've been using we've integrated the ability to have some of the multimedia aspects. So we've got quizzes built in. This one's obviously quite simple and can be edited as part of the editing function within the cards, but it just applies that functionality already. So you don't have to go in and add that as a different call out block. There are elements where you'd still need to go in and maybe add in additional items like watch the video here, but it's obviously pulled that through. And here you can see that it's also pulled in all of the different values that are in that document. My first nudge has already posted here below as well. If I click through and show you another card, it should bring to life how we've actually here taken out some of the more multimedia aspects such as emojis. we have been able to add in more of the poll functionality, which keeps it a little bit more engaging. And Dan has gone through and actually customised some of these so that it builds in some images and keeps more Barclays level colours, so the blue pulling through for a call out box. So those are elements that are customisable. Sorry, Gary, you've got your hand up, so I'll pause. 

36:20 | Ball
Yeah, thank you. You mentioned you pulled through a video. Would that have been in the original source document that was shared? 

36:30 | Rowena
yeah i believe it was let me jump back and i can click through i think i did a practice version with this document and it pulled it through and it linked to learning lab so i then couldn't get through to it so it might do the same no this one i think has just maybe pulled through as an example so i think it's just got a placeholder in dan you might be able to talk to what the model's done there but. 

36:54 | Dan
Yeah, so we have video blocks that stream as well as URLs to be able to link to external sources. We haven't quite built in the video blocks to stream yet, although we know that we can do it in terms of if you were to give a URL to Buzz in the discovery chat, and that was to be replicated in that workspace, it should pull through. So a couple ideas we've got is defining learning assets. So being able to extract things like images, videos, you're really defining those. So if, for example, a learning designer already knows what they need to build a course with, for example, they might have diagrams, they might already have internal videos, they can add those to the learning assets and those things will be pulled through. But that's a work in progress at the moment. So this version, if it does put videos in, it may be doing it in a bit of a haphazard way. 

37:41 | Ball
okay yeah thank you and with the because it's quite there's it's creating this kind of text content can you give an instruction about imagery to use and visuals to use or how to. 

37:55 | Dan
Yeah, so I can tell this one as well. So images, we now can use DALI and also other tools like stable diffusion to add images in. Obviously, the difficulty with those is that they're more decorative than actual kind of helpful things. What we have also been experimenting with is mermaid diagrams, which have been quite good in terms of AI can define mermaid diagrams and put those in. So that's on the roadmap as well. And then, again, that learning asset piece, if we already have visuals, So one of the examples that we were thinking of with Barclays is working on Evo. We know that there's a preference for the imagery that you've already got in your image library, your brand assets. At the moment, this version will generate thumbnails for those pathways and images using DALI. But can we perhaps, for example, have a stock of images that our tool can pull from? I think we probably can. It's just kind of things that, if you think that's really valuable, then please let us know, because that's the kind of thing that I'd love to start giving to our product team to push that forward. 

38:52 | Ball
think that'd be useful i think it'd be more it'd be i quite like what you were leaning towards before where if you could give it a block of text and have it create an image that represents that text through some sort of visual medium you know i think that's as useful as well because it it's more powerful isn't it i think if you've got you know yeah. 

39:13 | Dan
I can give you a quick example. I don't know if you've got access to the, Romina, the, the Evo group that we've just built. 

39:20 | Rowena
yes yeah i'll pull it up and this one actually is one where it's been created using dali through the existing prompt the one that i've got on the screen which we didn't include in the barclays sandbox org just because we know that there are lots of brand requirements on what images like this in the brand style need to look like so it might be that we could be more specific with the prompt which then helps us create images that maybe a little bit more reflective of the Barclays brand, but I'll jump in and find the Evo one while you're talking, Dan. 

39:57 | Dan
Basically, it was a very simple example, but we thought diagrams are just so much more powerful than nothing at all. And we know that too much text is not great for learning experiences. And so there's a pathway, I think, in weeks five to eight that refers to the GROW model. I think it may be week five. And so just as a quick sort of nod to learners being able to visualize something as well as learn from it. It's in the card. Sorry, I'm looking at my own screen rather than yours. So let me just share mine. 

40:26 | Rowena
I've got mine up. 

40:29 | Dan
it's, so it's, 

40:34 | Ball
Sorry, go ahead. Even just if it could be making decisions and pulling from a library that we supply, that could be quite advantageous to us as well, because then it saves the designers going through the library each time. 

40:48 | Dan
Yeah, exactly. So this was just an automatic grow model, just to give the learner a different perspective on something and to make it stand out. But yes, we can do both things, I believe. having a library of assets that we can pull from or using some of these tools that are a bit more experimental, but definitely exciting to start constructing that for us. We've even started to think about like one day how might Sora be able to do things for us in terms of videos and stuff. So yeah, from a learning design perspective, because one of the big feedbacks we had to start with was this is way too text heavy. So multimedia, how we can then deploy other clever solutions to create really vibrant, engaging kind of learning experiences is definitely on our minds at the moment. 

41:29 | Rowena
And I think this example is one where we've pulled from the existing Barclays library of images that we've got access on the brand portal. So for instance, that would be something that could pull through automatically as part of that sprint builder if we set it up in the back end to do that. It's just that it's set up at the moment to pull through from DALI. We would need access to the library of content and probably some good descriptive work that goes on behind the scenes to make sure that those images can easily be identified to pull through correctly for each different pathway. This is something we can explore if that's something of interest as well. 

42:11 | Dan
I know. Also on the roadmap, one of my colleagues who specializes in R &D and innovation here is thinking about how we can use AI to research the web as well in a much better way. So knowing that there's limitations in any LLM's knowledge base, because it's only as wise as its last training was, figuring out how we can use all those wonderful tools to pull from the active web is something that's in our mind. And not just to pull anything, but to pull good quality stuff. because in our team we've always had the philosophy of not just picking the first result from the first Google search, but really going deep into finding what's that really engaging methodology that no other learning kind of design would give, that what makes that youtube video so special it's not just a talking head it's actually got someone telling you something that's very practical so trying to figure out how we can leverage all of our learning design expertise at hive to really search the web in a way that makes sense for us but also i think that will be adjustable in terms of what methodologies are important at barclays what really makes a barclays learning course a barclays learning course that's the kind of thing that i'm really most excited by is how we can tweak this tool to work for other people's methodologies because I totally appreciate that every company has its own way of doing things and there's no one way when it comes to learning experience design so yeah the more you want to throw at us in terms of what you think you're capable of doing the more we can hopefully see if we can do that. 

43:32 | Rowena
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Stan. And I guess on that point, one of the questions I have before we move on to just making sure that you've all got access to the sandbox environment and checking that you can run your own tests and go in and use the Sprint Builder is around how do you see your team using this? And if there's any extra functionality that you think would add more value to Barclays, just so that we can explore that. 

44:12 | Ball
Yeah, I mean, I think this all looks quite promising. I think, as I said before, I think our initial thoughts just in terms of how we've been testing is really kind of breaking it down into much smaller tasks, sort of, as John said, to help us kind of augment our current learning design creation process. So rather than the full stack of creating a full piece of content or a full kind of sprint in the way that you say that, it's more sort of helping with individual tasks that help us build up a larger sprint. Because I guess, I think to emphasize with our workflow as learning designers, and I'll let the experts here add more detail if I haven't said it properly, but quite like, often we are creating things from scratch, but quite often we're updating existing pieces of work as well. We might be sort of building on something, sort of adapting something, or just updating something as well. There's often small, important tasks done as part of that, but the actual, let's start from scratch and build something up, that's only sometimes what we do, whereas there are these kind of tasks where we've pulled out these key use cases, which we do almost every time we do work. So that's probably what we'll be, I think, looking at this, we can probably have a go at just sort of, I think, When it comes time to be running the test, it seems that we could probably achieve most of those with this. I think probably working with you, Dan, on whether it's a mixture of Curator and the other tools to actually get there, but then nothing to say that we couldn't start testing. 

45:49 | Rowena
Great. Thanks, Dan. You've got your hand up. I'll let you go first. 

45:52 | Dan
Yeah, sorry, I'm full of ideas and I'm probably breaking our product team's roadmap completely. But Mike, I love your question there about, again, thank you for reminding me about the individual elements of stuff. In the back behind the scenes Buzz Labs tool, we have, for example, the ability to upload a card from the Hive learning platform. And for example, just to add a series of quizzes in or to use that existing content to do something slightly different with it. So we use it for updating content as well. Is that the kind of thing that you think would be really valuable from a Barclays perspective so that you can maintain existing courses as well as building ones from scratch? 

46:27 | Ball
I'd say so. I'd say so. I think the use case we're looking for at the now, and not to say that won't evolve over time, is very much to help kind of augment our professional learning designers. So it's less sort of taking things from scratch or trying to automate the whole process. It's how can we be making... Essentially, we're kind of measuring on two things, basically sort of speed and productivity and then quality as well. So the expectation is that we can kind of make certain parts of our process faster and also that we can potentially kind of increase the quality of certain parts, and that's what we're looking for at the moment. We're not really interested in testing at the moment, automating and sort of setting up a whole separate process where we can just push a few buttons and create things. At the moment, we just think there's too many open questions for that, whereas actually there are things that we can achieve now with augmentations. 

47:16 | Dan
Cool. That makes sense. One experiment you might find useful is if you upload a document that contains an existing learning course and asking it to sort of maybe redo it for a different audience, say for a manager rather than a people leader. And if you just feel free to try whatever you'd like to in that workspace. Although some of those categories are listed as, for example, sprint cadence or sprint context, that information gets passed through the tool into the card generation phase. So if you want to have a go at asking it to do something really specific, like here's a bit of information, I want you to have that information as close to the original as possible, but add some quizzes in, feel free to give that a go. hit any hurdles then let me know and that's just good insight for me as well to go back to our product team with that that's because I think you're right like when you get to the stage of having developed that Sprint anyway you kind of want the ability to more micro edit the content and I know that in our roadmap we do have a full kind of idea in motion to be able to edit existing content using AI on a block by block basis so for example if you were to build content in a card on Hive right now you'd be able to manually press add block and you'd do it manually. But in future, we'd like it to be add block and for AI to propose what that block should be based on the card that you've just given it. So that's all in our minds too. So I really appreciate you flagging that. No, thank you. 

48:35 | Ball
definitely the sort of thing we do for mandatory training like we would maybe sort of have an existing module and then we would try and suggest a couple of updates to the policyholders each year so it might be we would take the existing module and we would say we want that content but we want to write a more engaging intro or like you said we want to add a few more interactions throughout the module and yeah if we could use an ai tool to sort of do that or even sort of generate some proposed options that we could demo to the stakeholder, that sort of thing would be really useful. 

49:16 | Ball
Thank you. 

49:16 | Rowena
yeah that's i think those are really useful examples so thank you what we'll do is dan and i can go away and talk about actually we've got a couple of other tools that we're developing number one what dan's been showing you in the background which is actually an internal tool that he uses for the learning experience design we've got some other external tools which could probably be used to help prompt and get some different information out of the cards. So we'll take that away and if there's anything useful we can share about how you could use that in the learning design team, then we'll follow up with that. In the meantime, what I want to do quickly before I end the call is I want to share in the chat the link to the sandbox group and make sure that you're all able to access. If any of you work off multiple email addresses, that's where sometimes the SSO might need to be checked, so I'm just to share that link in the chat, please do just click on that. And if you are struggling to access, it might be because we hold a different email on our SSO file for you. But it should hopefully work because I've added you all. I've made you all admin members. And the one thing that I just want to flag is when you access the sprints here, So through that left hand panel where you go into sprints and then where I showed you would create a new sprint is that you click on that button or the one up there on the right hand side. You can see the sprints that anyone else has created as part of an admin user. So I've made you all admin users, which means you can all create sprints. You can only run one in this group at once. So that's just worth bearing in mind. If you click start sprint and there's already one running, then you might not be able to kind of run them all at the same time. but I can jump in and see one here that Dan has created. And if you start a sprint and don't finish it or just come up as an untitled, you can go in and delete those. You can see here, this is the one that Dan made earlier. And do feel free to just tidy it up as well so you can delete that one or rename if you want to put your own name against it just so you know which ones you've created. 

51:36 | Ball
Thank you so much. Just one question might not be for this meeting, but how long can we potentially have access to the sandbox for? I know that within our experimentation sprints that we're doing now, we've got the next couple spoken for, but then we would be looking to start experimenting with hives. So will we still have access to this in a month or a couple months' time? 

52:01 | Rowena
yeah i can work out the access for you mike so if you let me know when you're planning on doing the next sprint on your side to work on this i'll make sure that you get access during that period what i'll do is i'll leave it open now for you to be able to access it in the meantime even if you're not able to put in the kind of focused time on it and i'll just make sure that it's available during the window that you're doing the testing. 

52:29 | Ball
Wonderful. Thank you. We can come back to you with that sort of exact timing that we need. And it also doesn't have to be the entire group at once as well, because we'll be having certain designers running tests on certain things. So we could just sort of plan it out that way if that works for you. 

52:43 | Rowena
That sounds good and more than happy to book in any more time with other people in the team or follow up closer to the time. We do have five minutes left, so more than happy to answer any other questions anyone has before we let you go away and have a play around with the tool. And I'd also say do feel free to use this group as like a collaborative environment. I'll post on the dashboard to just get a video going just with the instructions of how to use it for anyone who's not joined the session. But feel free to just share in comments or tag me or Dan and we'll be able to come back and answer any questions that come up. It's quite nice if you can share your experiences with everyone else in the group and learn from each other as well. 

53:31 | Ball
can i just quickly ask you since we've got a couple of minutes left is the is all of the output posted on the hive learning platform for users as well so if we use this as a content creation tool users would have to access it through the hive platform or is it something that can be brought into our like learning lab slash workday learning platform. 

53:53 | Rowena
Yeah, it's a great question and one we get asked quite often. So the way that we have created this tool is to be hosted on Hive and that's largely because of the interactive elements that are brought in throughout it. It's also created in terms of content for a social and collaborative learning experience. So having the comments features at the bottom where you can then engage in conversations. We are looking at how we do the content creation piece is a more modular system where you could then say create content for learning lab or for other areas that you'd be looking to use it at barclays so gary actually if there are any you know questions you've got or ideas around that feel free to drop me an email i can then explore it with some of our team and provide some more detailed responses back to you on kind of what's possible everything at the moment is created with the view of posting on hive that's the structure and the format and the methodology that dan's spoken through. 

55:01 | Rowena
perfect any last questions the last few minutes otherwise we'll give you a couple of minutes back. 

55:07 | Ball
Thank you for your time, Rowena. Thank you. Very exciting. 

55:10 | Ball
Yeah, excellent, Shane. 

55:11 | Ball
Thanks very much. Thanks. 

55:15 | Ball
See you later, bye. Cheers, bye bye.
