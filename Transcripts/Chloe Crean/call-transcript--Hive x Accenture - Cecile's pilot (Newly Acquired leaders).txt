hi cecil. 

0:01 | Cecile
Hey, hey guy. 

0:03 | Chloe
Hello. How are you? Hello? 

0:05 | Cecile
I'm good. What about you? Yeah. 

0:09 | Chloe
Yeah, not too bad. Thank you. Okay. Like I've got a bit of hay fever at the moment which is weird because it's very wintery and rainy outside but yeah, I'm all good. I just feel a bit sleepfully it's all. 

0:24 | Cecile
Maybe allergy also sometime in the. 

0:26 | Chloe
Yeah, yeah, maybe I didn't realise I had any analogies. So hopefully not that, who knows might have happened, no, you? 

0:34 | Cecile
The climate change or whatever. Yeah, but hopefully you're not feeling too tired, but yeah, the weather is not, we are all looking forward to have some nice weather. No, yeah. Going back in where we were. 

0:50 | Chloe
In it rained continuously yesterday after work. I haven't seen it rain like that in so long, but I think it's because we a, we've had quite nice weather over the weekend and you're paying now? Yeah, exactly. It just didn't stop. So that's not very nice today, but it's all good. But, yeah, good to see. My lawyer said that anyway… yeah, I could see the kind of amendments from accenture on the statement of work in msa. My lawyer said that it, it's looking like pretty good that there's no kind of big concerns. So she's just gonna add in like the latest kind of what we've agreed on like commercials and things like that peculiar. 

1:42 | Cecile
Yeah, I had that it back in there, but I don't know for, I think it's better if you're right in it. The only question I, why is it still written in an, and that was my question. I didn't know if there was a reason or, yeah. 

1:57 | Chloe
Yeah, we want it in dollars, right? 

2:00 | Cecile
Yeah, I think that's what we said. But again, I don't know what has been negotiated in terms of. So whatever, I mean, we agree on the account, but from a contracting perspective… yeah, just whatever works, it's just so I had written, I think in pounds. Yeah, I think we are good. And thanks again, I really appreciate the flexibility I shared with Becca yesterday, so I think it helps tremendously to have removed some of the barriers to decision making. And thanks for that. I really appreciate. So, I have no idea about the next steps now. I just, it's with you. So once we get the review, we still need to work on the update on the responsible. I, part of it, the content. Yeah, the content I had sent you a few things. 

2:58 | Chloe
Yeah. 

2:59 | Cecile
Yeah. I confirm it's a number one. I mean, all the client accounts within can I'm speaking to beyond the vna says that, that's the best country point to. And now, because it's everyone speaks about responsibility all the time and the people understand diversity because of the mistakes that they could do in front of the client, potentially not taking into account. Someone was saying, yeah, we were working for client and we were using a generated avatar or something like that and it was a woman. So it was for a car industry and it was a white blond woman, you know, and, you know, the star type just selling cards, these type of things where immediately you understand. Okay. So how do you avoid it's? A, it's a very complex one. But that I think, in the mind of the people that are ending by that will fix their mind. I think a little bit more about why we discussed about that one. So, and I don't think it's a big work knowing there are thousands of articles… in the yeah enterprise in the media et cetera. So that's the only thing I think for the rest we work good on the… signing up, yeah, format. 

4:19 | Chloe
Yeah. So, the form and, yeah, so that was my question. So once we well, maybe so once we send back the amendments on the statement of work et cetera? And we both agreed, is it just that will be signing? Is it quite a simple process? Is there anything in between that just back signing? And then that's done? Yeah, fully. 

4:42 | Cecile
What are the next steps? Yeah, I don't know what other steps use for the one year to sign out of that? No. Yeah. Once we review, I think it's like… let's go. I have already circulated now the sign up form et cetera. So I already have one account which is selected for gross markets. I will have one also for Europe. So I have a minimum or America also. So I have one in each market. So I think that should be okay. The only question, I keep having, I know we had discussed is the a, we have some accounts where they have only five people or something like that. We would like to do it. So should we keep one which is always open? Yeah, where we don't do the prompts et cetera. So which is more like, you know, always open and you can do in the time you want, that could be another. 

5:41 | Chloe
I do that because it, that would be in a way like an unserviced group as well. So it's obviously, it's easy for us to be like, okay, if you want to be added to it, that's fine. We can always keep an eye on it. Like, if the engagement is really low and like people just aren't really doing it, then we can be like look that doesn't really work and, or you could add like those different groups of five people, we could add them together into one group that. 

6:05 | Cecile
Together. But I think having one just to simplify if you have, you know, I don't know how we pull that, you know, and we are bringing people because I expect again we have a few of them, we need to have like a very simple answer. Okay. Yeah. Fine. Just sign the names and we will add them on the platform. It's just that they will not have the kickoff call. They will not just maybe we just prepare and you may welcome. This is how this is going to work et cetera. We recommend you do once a week now if you want to do everything in a row. So maybe we prepare, you know, a top like that for that group where and… yeah, but you will not be able to do the prompt otherwise will be, or maybe the prompt is only have you looked at your, have you completed all of them? So something very generic. 

6:57 | Chloe
And so with that, who would those people be then just companies where there is only a couple of people going? 

7:02 | Cecile
Yeah. Sometimes we have small acquisitions or they don't have a lot of leaders, and they are still interested. So, yeah, because what I said is I, to have like the right experience, you need to have at least a minimum of 15 people active otherwise, you know? Yeah. So that's what I recommend. So. And this for this, they said we have five leaders and it's not a small acquisition. It's just the number of, you know, people at the very top. And the problem sometimes is it, it's either like five either like 25. So because of the, if you go to the next level. So… so anyway, so I, he said I can find other people so I can manage to get to 10. But I'm still wondering if we low 15 if we could not have and maybe we have bigger activities. So without the big ones, they have their own set. They do an, that they have, you know, and then we always have an open with minimal effort on your side. 

8:03 | Chloe
Yeah, yeah, we could do that. And I suppose the other side is, do you combine different acquisitions or would you rather keep them separate? No, that. 

8:13 | Cecile
So that would be, we would combine them in that case. 

8:16 | Chloe
But then I suppose it could be a, it could still be the usual kick off call, tried content managed even though because that would then be more than 15 people if we combine, but they're probably. 

8:29 | Cecile
The problem is because none of them remember are going to decide at the same time. 

8:36 | Chloe
Yeah. Okay. Good. So. 

8:37 | Cecile
The problem is if you have, yeah, I don't know which one decide we want to launch next week so we can say, okay, let's do it and then you have the other one. Yeah, I was waiting for an approval. So for us, it will be in the month, and then you have these people. So that's what I mean. So date or we could have like a monthly call, you know, open like for anyone joining the experience, and we send the people to this one whenever they want to start. That could be another option. And, but I, a proper of per SE would be difficult for the ones who are going to come as a, remember, they operate. Each of them have a different time frame. It's like mini companies. So, so I'm trying to oversimplify based on the experience of the first round where last minute the people were changing on by the way XYZ, then we were. So we need to wait. They were asking us, can you wait for the launch? Because I may have other people joining in two weeks, so. 

9:40 | Chloe
It waiting and then nothing but. 

9:42 | Cecile
You keep waiting and nothing happens. So I just prefer to see a case over simplify. We knew also, we know some people have done it in a week. The other question, I got knowing we have shortened the experience. So we have the same content. So it's four weeks. So I don't remember how we have combined decisions. I don't remember, I might be. 

10:03 | Chloe
Look at that. I can speak to my team as well and just be like, how would we shorten it? Because I think. 

10:09 | Cecile
If it's 20 minutes instead of 15, that's totally fine. If it's you know, half an hour. 

10:15 | Chloe
Because I think I can add you back in to this group if you… want to take a look, where is the group? 

10:31 | Chloe
My group button is gone, but yeah, I can copy this over all into a draft group and re, add you and shall I re, add Alex? Yeah as well. I guess we've got this draft group here. So, yeah, at the moment, we have, so, yeah, we've got seven pathways… but like you say, so it's only four weeks. 

10:55 | Cecile
It's only four weeks. So mathematically we have to do something. So I had that question and I pretend it was all. Yeah. How did you? Yeah, we are going to regroup. Yeah, I have no idea. So no, it means, so it would be to, we have seven. So we can do. 

11:11 | Chloe
Nine minutes. I mean, I can add all the pathways up and actually see, how much time is it. And then we can also have like an optional content beneath as to like if you want to read further, you can hear that this is what we expect you to do. And then in terms of that responsible gnei, do you want that in one of these modules or a separate pathway? No, I think is you want to in hear? 

11:34 | Cecile
In, in sorry, I have a lot of light now. I don't see what I have written. 

11:40 | Chloe
Why inclusive design matters? 

11:44 | Cecile
Engaging with your clients? Yeah, we increase inclusive. Yeah, that's there is a on the top, the inclusive, no, no, that's my screen. No, no, no, no. I was seeing another letter so there is a lot of light on my screen. So under the roof, yeah. Suddenly, you know, a lot of sun, I can't see anything to close the window. Yeah, that would be with why inclusive design matter? The concept of inclusive design. I'm wondering if, how does it fit? I need to review it. Again. It's not as simple as I said, take action to inclusive design a. 

12:23 | Chloe
Alex back in now so that you can go ahead and have a look and I think feel free to add anything in or just let us know, on the Microsoft teams chat, but yeah, I can also. 

12:37 | Cecile
A different thing because I don't know if you may have a perspective. I don't know if you have any experts on that topic, but responsible, I is technically there is. So it's an inclusive design concept in responsible I, but, you know, which one is first. So do we discuss about because it's an offering… actually? Responsible? I is an offering where inclusive design is not because inclusive design is a concept responsible. So I wish we have a research topic articulating all of that. That's not a, yeah. Yeah. If you, if you have ideas otherwise, we'll yeah. 

13:22 | Chloe
On this because they are inclusion and diversity experts. And so, they are like prompt engineers now. So actually, I think they'll be really good at this topic. Okay. Yeah. If you. 

13:34 | Cecile
You can help on that one because, I think there are different ways to do it. It's just… because a, maybe the one way, to get their attention is to start by AI and response, sorry, responsible AI because that's apparently that… yeah, that's how we get the people understanding why I need to discuss with mica. It's totally connected with the client or maybe we put it in the client dimension. Maybe that's where it fits. Because so, you set up the concept of inclusive design. We put a little bit of responsible I in terms of it. And then how do we work with clients? There are some examples of responsible. Maybe we can pick some examples about where we, what does it mean not to have… any attention on any human attention to it? Because the systems are complex et cetera. So maybe that fits better, but I let your team thinking about it and I will discuss with Alex in parallel. Yeah. 

14:35 | Chloe
No, I think that's good. And then I suppose just to get a bit of an understanding on, I don't know. Have you heard much from like Zoe and Ali in terms of like the other pilot? And I guess they were saying in June might have budget there. Okay? No problem. So, yeah, I think that's basically everything. Hopefully we could get it signed off this week then and we could get going on just kind of finalizing… the content and like getting those first sets of acquisitions on board. And then, yeah, we can kind of get going. Hopefully, yeah, that'd be good. Cool. Thank you, Joe. 

15:18 | Cecile
For the patience. Yeah, we need to close now because yeah, I think early June, we cannot start later. 

15:23 | Chloe
Yeah, no. 

15:24 | Cecile
That then it's going to be the summer and then we will miss the, you know, the summer and it will be september. So it's just, we are wasting. 

15:30 | Chloe
Yeah, no, I'm quite confident definitely on our side that we can sign off this week. Hopefully, there's just nothing else. We're not pushing back on anything big. So I think we should be able to agree, and then move forward. Okay? Hopefully I'll let you know otherwise. Thank you. Cool. Yeah, I'll catch up with you next week probably, but speak to you on teams. All right. Thank you. 

15:51 | Cecile
Thank you so much, Chloe. Bye bye bye.
