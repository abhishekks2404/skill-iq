0:00 | Kathryn
hi, Catherine. Hi, how are you doing? I think I've got my camera. 

0:05 | Chloe
No problem. Yeah, I'm good. Thank you. Yeah, I'm getting into the week. How are you? Yeah. 

0:13 | Kathryn
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Hang on. Just go. Just be just been to GPS GP, you know, how it is us only just like that. I was like admin, yeah, trying to get through the life. Admin are like, yeah, but I made a GP appointment. I've been putting off for like four months. Yeah. 

0:31 | Chloe
Yeah, god. Well, a. 

0:34 | Kathryn
And, how are you? How are things being with you and I? 

0:41 | Chloe
Yeah, we've been good. Yeah, lots of change, lots of development coming on with like our products and where we're trying to take our Jenny I, products to kind of the next level. I think when we spoke last time like we're speaking about like buzz curate. Well, it was, probably that would change the name so many times, yeah, but. 

0:59 | Kathryn
Is like the cra and the core. 

1:01 | Chloe
Content piece and we're in a live beta trial now with prospects and customers. So getting direct feedback really as to like how that can support people. But what will be coming soon is the document ingestion. So when you can literally upload meeting notes or existing content where you on the IP and say, build me a learning program and pathway from this. So, yeah, I think. 

1:27 | Kathryn
I think the biggest. 

1:28 | Chloe
Challenge it's helping with is like, how do you keep, how do you use what you already have? And also keep it up to date? So it's been quite an interesting one with that. And yeah, lots of other pieces and some people moving around in teams. So that's always interesting to see kind of what happens next. But yeah, how are you? How have things been? I know there was kind of lots of movement on your side as well. 

1:52 | Kathryn
Yeah. I mean when, we had quite, yeah, we had quite a lot of changes. So they, yeah, so we had some organizational changes where we were sort of all organised together in a talent function. So we had our kind of skill strategy piece, like more like the talent management piece and learning and sort of learning experience like all together. And now that's been split out. So they kind of head of talent. And my boss did left as part of that reorg our head of skills strategy left. And so now we're kind of more like more just learning and development I suppose now. And yeah. So, but richard's Rich is still around. I don't think he's joining the meeting. Is he not? 

2:39 | Chloe
No, he declined. 

2:41 | Kathryn
But, yeah, he's not been very well with like a chest infection. So I think he try not to have to too many meetings. 

2:48 | Chloe
Yeah. 

2:49 | Kathryn
But yeah. So Richard and I still were still on still working together. So like most teams still here, we're just kind of… yeah, it's a lot of organizational changes making a 1,000 staff redundant globally. So it's kind of like, you know, like, you know, a bit like waiting for all of that change to go through. 

3:11 | Chloe
The emotional side of it as well, I think is always like they're all people like they might be your friends and it's a really awkward environment I think from. 

3:19 | Kathryn
Yeah, it's been quite tough for a while to be honest because it was like they made that announcement a few months ago and then since then everybody's like my god, who am, I may have done his, your main? 

3:31 | Chloe
Yeah, but. 

3:32 | Kathryn
That came already off the back of a few earlier waves. So I think people are a, I, a bit tight… and kind of one. I think people are like, look, you know, a, okay. But I would be good to have it done and then we can kind of move forward so that's all supposed to be wrapping up sort of towards end of June. So I think there probably there be a bit of time re, adjustment but I think then probably more Q3. I think we'll be a bit more back business as usual. But the good news for us is that we are going ahead with our management leadership programs this year because everything was a bit on pending budget. And… then we need to think about… like the other kind of priorities I'm thinking about, okay, I think, which I said to you before is like, okay, where we've got people who might be identify talent or where we've got people that are coming through into kind of broader roles. How can we develop them at scale? And that's where I was thinking maybe Hive could be an option for that? Maybe not this year but perhaps into next year when we're kind of doing our budgeting cycle. Sorry, that was a bit rambly. Was that, was that helpful? 

4:45 | Chloe
It is a, good update. Thank you. And, and yeah, I think, yeah, there's a lot of redundancyes happening all over, the place and I think specifically in tech as well. I know it's happening a lot, so, it's a tough time I think out there for everybody at the moment. But yeah, I mean, obviously, you know that like our bread and butter is essentially a leadership and management programs… and yeah, like identifying talent and have like, I like top performers. How do you kind of provide them something that's a bit more cohort based learning? I think, the interesting thing we've been discussing as well is like the, our second Jenny it, which is the buzz facilitator and that's essentially where like leaders or like, yeah, those upcoming high performing managers could practice conversations with buzz before having to go and do it. So it's like another significant part on how do we embed the learning? So yes, you've read the card, you've answered a polar, a quiz. You've may be discussed with your peers. Now go and practice with buzz facilitators. 

5:49 | Kathryn
On. 

5:49 | Chloe
how, you know, how would you implement that? And you have full reign really over who you want buzz facilitated to play basically. And we basically would put in, you know, this is all the context. So it's fidelity. These are their values. This is the leadership framework we want to test with this learner. And here's the scenario. So they might have to go and have a difficult conversation with a direct report. So you can. 

6:13 | Kathryn
have it as like. 

6:14 | Chloe
Role play scenario or you can have it as you're actually testing them on a specific framework in a roundabout way. And then we can measure the effectiveness of how have they actually understood this topic? So that's been quite, yeah, an exciting part for a number of organisations because they like the idea of coming there to practice and to it, yeah, put it. 

6:39 | Kathryn
That's a good idea. So this got the, so can you tell me at? So how do you wanna use the next? Not sure, no idea who that is… what would be a good use of the time? Is there anything that you think this is a really good update to how to show you? Yeah. Is there a, is there a, is there anything that would be good to like take a look at demo wise? I think as I said, like, what my most would be helpful for you? I guess, yeah. What, what we're thinking about is, yeah, how could we develop talent at scale the other opportunity from what you just said, I think is yeah, looking to kind of embed leadership behaviors but like to like embed kind of values and behaviors throughout the organisation, kind of bring that through more into the induction. So if you've got any case studies, of that or anything, any piece of the functionality where you're like, you know, that it's working really well. I'd be interested to learn about that. 

7:40 | Chloe
Yeah. I'm sure I could show you something I probably showed you kantar last time, but I think I can bring to life at least like the buzz curator within that I'll just show you. 

7:52 | Kathryn
Yeah. It also interested in, yeah, in a curator? 

7:57 | Chloe
Yeah. So I've got this slide just to take a step back on. Yeah, what we were trying to do. So the way that we're really thinking about it is like what the challenges with upskilling and reskilling employees, and how does the organization react? How can L and D react quick enough because typically traditional methods are a bit slow or they're not tailored enough and they're not supporting the needs of the organisation quick enough. So we thought of it really across like three sets of people. So L and D designers, how can we provide them tech and a tool to be able to quickly create content? So that's buzz curator be able to upload documentation, create so, and it's really tailored, it writes all the content for you at the moment. We'd say it gets to you about 80 percent of the way they're. 

8:44 | Kathryn
pretty. 

8:44 | Chloe
Tech space like text heavy, and then you use in platform tools to add poles, quizzes, mini videos, et cetera. And that's really, I think empowering land teams to take on control of actually, okay. I'm gonna, I've had this request from sales. I'm gonna build this learning program right now and like I can give it to them tomorrow and they can roll it out a few days later, like it's all that speed and agility, 

9:08 | Kathryn
okay. 

9:10 | Chloe
And then that next part is, okay, what about employees? How do we provide them something that is bite size, actionable tailored enough, but also where they can practice. So that's where buzz facilitate comes in and they can actually embed the learning themselves. And then this third one is impact and that's really around, you know, how do we support business leaders? Maybe when they pay for a certain L and D initiative? How do they know the ROI? How can they measure the impact of that program? And has it really been effective? So that's really where our three I to into it, the buzz curator, buzz facilitate, and then buzz insights with buzz insights. It's basically an AI generated sprint report. So at any point when you're finishing a sprint on a particular cohort can generate this report and within a few minutes, it will go into like the involvement completion levels give you insight into those people and what they've been doing and where engagement peaks have been, even the impact of like nudges. And then also I think a cool one is like the influencers who are key influencers that are spiking engagement, when did they come? And what did I, what affect did it have on the group. So those are the three tools. Would it be helpful to see buzz curator and bus? 

10:26 | Kathryn
Yeah. 

10:26 | Chloe
The total. 

10:27 | Kathryn
It would, yeah, yes. 

10:30 | Chloe
I'll go into those, which one, this one and yeah, we've been running a lot of different programs recently. Like I say we, we've always focused on management embedding values, upskilling and leadership development. But a cool use case with booper at the moment is they want to do a future capabilities for leaders program and they have six key behaviors. One of them is data, how do we make data driven decisions? Another one is digital. So we've done a sprint on each one. And then we have, this is a bit weird and then, but that's what's been really different for us is that we're not the subject matter experts in data or digital. So what we've done is we've interviewed subject matter experts. We've taken their insights, asked them some questions and we've taken that transcript and then uploaded that into our buzz curator tool and created a learning sprint. It's a great way to also. 

11:29 | Kathryn
But, but we also on our side could do that as well, right? So if we were like, okay, we want to create this fidelity gen, AI sprint. What's fidelity doing with genai? We would use our folks in innovation and, we might already have the materials and we can upload it. 

11:49 | Chloe
Yeah. Exactly. So where we're at right now? Like say, so we're doing the document upload in the back end at the moment. But where it will get, actually… we have so many different versions of this buzz curator because our product team are moving so fast with it. So in a few weeks, we'll be able to do the buzz curator, document upload, which actually might be quite interesting for you if you wanted to do the beta, like if you wanted to. 

12:17 | Kathryn
Yeah, I think we've got a few use cases for that because we also in my team, we do also look after some more kind of more technical training where we really get content out of smes, and then to turn it into training. So, you know, get that knowledge from them and make it into training sales. Is, is one area where we do a bit of that product… is another? 

12:44 | Chloe
Yeah, I think, yeah, it'd be great to get you on that and, you know, we're in this stage where we really want feedback, what's working? What is that we can make those adjustments and obviously gives you a chance to play with the tool. But this is essentially where we're at now. So I think previously I wanna show you it's probably out of the platform. Obviously now is in the platform whenever you want to build a sprint. So here I'll talk you through your needs and goals to create a high quality learning experience. Are you ready to begin? Yes, and then buzz creator will start to ask you questions around what is the learning program that you want to build? So any for now it will come. So anything new, just any ideas you'd want to quickly build something on? 

13:30 | Chloe
Yeah. 

13:32 | Kathryn
Yeah. I mean, that sounds good. Mastering negotiation techniques. 

13:44 | Kathryn
I really. 

13:44 | Chloe
Can't spell today. Yeah. So then we've obviously been playing with the prompts back and forth in terms of, okay, what would a learning designer need to know? Obviously, I might want to know some key objectives. It, it can provide you some like, yeah, I say, can you provide suggestions? And here we have this. We've been calling it like scratch pad or like now we're calling it workspace, where it will start to basically pull out some of those kind of key objectives. What are the challenges that you're looking for? 

14:18 | Kathryn
So it's kind of building. 

14:20 | Chloe
An. 

14:21 | Kathryn
live next to you and then you can. 

14:23 | Chloe
Yeah. 

14:24 | Kathryn
Just. 

14:24 | Chloe
exactly once to collect information on the audience. What, what have they gone through before? You know, how long do you want the sprint to be? And then what are the a title? So it enables you to like change things and then like say there will be a basically a plus button here where you can also upload those documents and say, use this as source material. And that's I think really important for like values understanding like a leadership framework as well. So here it's considered some objectives, understand the principles of to negotiation negotiations, styles, develop skills. So this looks good. 

15:01 | Kathryn
Videos as well. So you like had some videos from? 

15:06 | Chloe
Yeah. So where are we in our next sprint run? Which I think will be in like the next seven weeks. So at the moment, it just filled text and then you can add in videos, you can add in video. 

15:18 | Kathryn
Yeah, but. 

15:19 | Chloe
Where it will get to is it will create multimedia sprints. So it will pull in videos and I think at this point, it will ask you like is this video something you were looking at? And then calls and quizzes et cetera. So I think where we're at it kind of we'd say it gets you like 70 percent of the way there. And then you can add in everything else. But eventually it will get you pretty much there in an, will it fall from. 

15:44 | Kathryn
your content on Hive or just our content that we give it? So it will pull from open ar. 

15:50 | Chloe
I actually, so. 

15:51 | Kathryn
Out there? 

15:53 | Chloe
And then, or if you just wanted it to pull from your own resources, you could tell it, you know, build something from this. 

16:00 | Kathryn
Right. Okay. 

16:01 | Chloe
Yeah. And then obviously, we have leadership content and inclusion content. So we could upload that as using at as. 

16:07 | Kathryn
Okay. 

16:08 | Chloe
Yeah. And then it says, can you show any inverse trends, business needs or expert insights to help build this? I mean, I could just say… don't have any. So you can kind of be as specific as you want to be, or you can kind of say, you know, provide suggestions either way it will provide you. And I think where we see this as well, that buzz curator could be put in the hands of a sales manager, like it could be put in the hands of any type of manager to build something for their team and then land just review it. So you're really helping to plug lots of different skill gaps quite quickly… or you give this to a subject matter expert and you say, look, can you just provide it with as much information as you can? And then we'll we take it from there, six week learning sprint, just say six week learning sprint. So, yeah, here it's pulled out the objectives. It's collecting the manager audience. And then it'll start to build these elements. So then it will eventually be like, okay, generate sprint, and then it will start to write all of that content in a sprint where it might have four or five, 15 minute pathways. And then you'll be able to edit it further on that point. Like I say, you can move things around schedule nudges so that basically when it's ready, you just click start and then it will do everything for you over the next seven weeks and keep that cohort together… right? And I suppose to show, yeah, sorry, we're gonna say something. 

17:48 | Kathryn
I'll save my question. Keep going on. This is like, 

17:53 | Chloe
yeah. So I suppose just to bring that to life then. So for example, kantar had this success framework. 

17:59 | Kathryn
Yeah. I remember this. I was like pretty nice. Yeah. 

18:02 | Chloe
Yeah. So they had like the six behaviours and it differs across all the different levels of leaders. And when we did a pilot, we started with leads with impact and we went to build great teams. They're now rolling out the entire program with six different sprints but they've applied buzz facilitate within that. So here and they've wrapped it around also with like, yeah, there's a kickoff launch call with Hive, they select, which sprint they want to focus on first. And then at the end of each sprint, they do a peer to peer session where only then is it marked complete if they do that peer to peer session. So it's really kind of wrapping it around with like the face to face element to. So here's one sprint that they have broken down into different pathways, connects to win another one. So we'll drip feed those to users. But to show you what the buzz facility. So they call it coach scenarios. So they started with before the sprint starts, they want to get a good understanding of where the leaders think they're at in terms of how they relate to build great teams. So this is all really specific and bespoke to canter. But here the first skill is assessing your teams operating context and needs to deliver current and future team goals. This involves understanding team dynamics et cetera, on a scale of one to 10. How company are you with this skill? And it just kind of runs through various different elements within the Bill, great teams and you can have that conversation with buzz. So that's it starts, you know, gets a good understanding of the base level of where people are at before that. And then they've used it also as a slightly different one. So roleplaying a difficult conversation. So here's all about building great teams. I'm here to help you role play a conversation involving difficult feedback. Let me know when you want to get started. Can you tell me more about the challenging conversation? So here it starts to collect that information, struggling to prioritize their work. And then what's good? And the feedback we had from some of our clients was that sometimes buzz would go straight into role play. And actually now it says, right, we're going into role play, and that's it out with that person. And then it says role play ended. And then it goes coaching feedback based on that conversation you've just had. 

20:22 | Kathryn
Okay. It gives a bit more upfront contracting and what you're going to be doing. 

20:27 | Chloe
Yeah, exactly. I'm like making it very clearly defined on the roles that buzz is playing. And then, yeah, after the sprint has finished, it wants to do a post sprint knowledge. So then we can compare how did it start? So, congratulations on making it as far on your learning journey. You've made great focus. Now we want to consolidate that learning so far. I'm gonna ask you a few reflective questions on the content on build great teams. Are you ready here? It says, can you describe a situation where you've had to assess your teams operating context and the skills needed to deliver current and future team goals? Yes, last week, we had… a, that's quite a difficult question that one but I think in that sense, like their response will really help you understand if they've read the content, have they actually understood and if they haven't that's fine. But we can focus on that going forward. Yeah, here, you'd maybe want them to say like some of the models that were in the content and that's the answer, that they should be using. So then you actually know if they've read the content and understood it. And with that, we'll collect insight around all of those different conversations and really get a good understanding of who's struggling or who needs certain help or support in different areas. So, yeah, that, that's kind of buzz facility. Like I said, we're playing with a lot of different scenarios at the moment. And some of the feedback also like a brick I think we're looking at like how can we just have buzz facilitate readily available for users to go there wherever they need to practice and have like a reset button to be able to just keep practicing no matter how many times. So that's been something that's been discussed as well. But yeah, I suppose, is that something you could see? 

22:17 | Kathryn
I think, yeah, I think, but then I think potentially the other one that's come into my mind that we've got a need for at the moment. It's like cultural awareness training. So I was like, I wonder if we, you could kind of build a sprint for that, get people to do a bit of practice. We've got, we've got because obviously, you know, but like sometimes bite size digital pathways are the definitely the right thing. But other times people do need more effort full learning environment like, so, yeah. So so we've got that. We've got a lot of the cultural awareness where it's a bit more like involved with a vendor longer term program bit more intensive. But then I think there's also a need for something that's… quicker and easier for more people to engage with the scale. So. 

23:13 | Chloe
I think. 

23:14 | Kathryn
This, that could be another kind of use case. One question. Sorry, I've got another meeting at half past but I'm sure I asked you this before, but how do people, I know, I'm sure. I know you can like brand Hive up. So it looks like it's your own platform with a branding and everything. But then how does like the back ends? Like reporting, how does that feed into an LMS… or we have water shed as well as like a learning record store? Is that possible just to kind of export data? Yeah, might be more of a technical question but that's what a single, how would you track through the progress and make sure it's captured in all of our global metrics. 

24:00 | Chloe
Yeah. So where we've previously done it is like we can literally give you a spreadsheet where it downloads all the information or we use BI, where all the information is there and we can download that and send that to you so that you know, you upload it or we can actually build integrations into like your LMS or into watershed where that information is going back there's a really big focus at the moment with our product team on integrations. Like I think we, I think we talk, I don't know if we spoke about it last time but, you know, like if you have your LMS and you want that to be the front door, then can Hive be a tile in your LMS? And it's all built through single signon and they don't have to keep accessing different places that's also something that we can explore. And I, yeah, that's a massive priority for us right now. So yeah, that's a. 

24:48 | Kathryn
Yeah, because I guess like people, sometimes I don't think it matters to you. Like sometimes I think people get overly worried about everything having to be sat in the same place, like people are used to different platforms, right? You can't just have one platform for everything although that would be, you know, that would be neat and like that would be ideal but cost wise, it's with all the integrations and the administration and as we, it, but yeah. So I was thinking, would it be? So, so I said we were like, okay, well, we'll do a try, you know, we'll do a pilot of cultural awareness. Would we just e-mail people would be like great. Yeah, you've signed up for this would get an like the kind of like launch call e-mail, they like click on it. They like work through it or can do mobile as well. 

25:29 | Chloe
Yeah. So it's an app on their phone, but yeah, we would take all of that on. So we do all the coms and engagement plan. We would do all the invites. We do all the surveys to people to like to sign up. We would do all the newsletters to drive people to come back and nudges. So we really do kind of take it and run and then just provide you with lots of Rich data and insight into like how is it going? 

25:54 | Kathryn
Okay. 

25:55 | Chloe
And then, yeah, just review like after the proof of concept, you know, what worked well? What's been the feedback from participants as well? Like we just ran a peer to peer session with booker and then we're doing a survey after that as well just to collect all of their insights because that's the point obviously have a proof of concept too. Is I really test if this works with this audience? Did they like it, if they didn't find that that's obviously the point of the proof of concept. So, yeah, that's. 

26:23 | Kathryn
yeah, I think that, yeah, I think like I'm going to have a chat with Richard on the kind of learning experience learning technology side. You might, Richard before, right? I think. 

26:33 | Chloe
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He. 

26:35 | Kathryn
Told me. 

26:36 | Chloe
Him a few weeks ago, but like you said, he had a chest infection, so. 

26:39 | Kathryn
Yeah, it's been quite. It's okay. Now like he's kind of, but yeah, he's on a page return back. But yeah, I would like if we can on our side kind of get the budget. I would really love to do a pilot of this probably initially with something that's a bit less of our own data because somebody don't run into all of our external security reviews. Maybe painful take this. If it was something like cultural awareness, you know, we're not going to have our own data in that like we might have our own materials but there's nothing commercially sensitive is not fidelity internal information. You know, it's not fidelity commercial information. So then we would probably be quite straightforward for us to do run a pilot via the app, but just get people to it. Like, so I just would really love to do a proof of concept pilot for it if we can get the budget and it's not too arduous on our side with the data security data privacy piece. Yeah, that's what. 

27:32 | Chloe
Yeah, exactly. I think cultural awareness is a, good place to start with that as well. And I suppose if you were to do a proof of contact, would that be like next year? Or do you think you'd be able to get something going? 

27:46 | Kathryn
We might be able to get something this year. It just, yeah, just depends like we need to kind of review. We did get some budget but I, we need to work out the allocation. I won't bore you with it, but yeah, we need to look, we need to, look at the budgets and kind of look at what the priorities are. But yeah, we've got kind of, I think managing through change cultural awareness. I think at a kind of two… kind of hot topics for us this year and if we get something turned around quickly as a pilot, I think that would be if we could get it done this year, that would be, really good. But yeah, so it depends on our side on budget and data issues. So, I, so next steps are with me. Can you send me over the pricing again? I send it to, so we have the pricing and I really like just slide like if you can send me the slides were really good, really clear and I think long, yeah, the curative tool does look really cool. I could definitely see that be something that we use because we're doing a lot of experimentation with AI with like, you know, we're a Microsoft copilot. We've got our own chat gpt but it can't just turn around of course, like you were like brilliant. We can create a we're like, yeah. 

29:02 | Chloe
Not exactly what, yeah. 

29:03 | Kathryn
Yeah, it is, they did the game and cool stuff, but in a word document, you know, like, so. 

29:12 | Chloe
I think that's it like when we say we chat to you… gosh. Sorry… hold… yeah, I think it's that like some people like, well, this is just a like chat to team. We're like it's not, it's actually right in the entire learning curriculum. I literally fresco. So it's more. 

29:31 | Kathryn
Yeah, it's yeah, it's totally different like, yeah, we've done quite a lot of experimental take a chat gpt and it's like for generating our learning content, granted, we have to only work with whitelisted sites, fidelity whitelisted like accessible sites, which is a bit limiting. But, we just haven't been able to like generate a full course out there. Maybe you'd get a learning resource, but like we were like I'll break and you develop, you know, design of classroom training for resilience. Can't do give you a first? I think it'll speed us up but I, yeah, I can't do that. Yeah, it's not visual. It's not creating anything too. So anyway, yeah, I love it. I think great tools. So core, yeah, if you can send me the pricing love to give this a pilot, if we can get the budget over the line, I'll speak to Richard and, my boss and see what we can do.
