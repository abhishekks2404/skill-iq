hi, Sarah. Hi. How are you doing? Hello? Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. Yeah, I was struggling to find a room. So, I'm just in the hallway basically. Are you in the office today? Yeah. Where are you? White city? So, it's like shepherd's Bush way, so, west london. Yeah, the white city mall area. Yeah. By westfield. Yeah, exactly. I like the BBC and stuff. Yeah, it was a bit rude but, and where do you live? I actually live in like, quite close like shepherd's Bush, kensington, olympia way, cool, which is quite ideal. 

0:50 | Sairah
And I think I'm gonna be looking at that, right? 

0:55 | Chloe
Too many scrolls. 

0:58 | Sairah
How have you been? 

1:00 | Chloe
Yeah, really good. Thanks. Yeah, it's been fairly busy but it's been good. It was nice to have a long bank holiday weekend as well. So. 

1:11 | Sairah
Yeah, I've I had those two back to back. Well, not back to back. Yeah, in between… you know what? For the first time ever, I've really struggled with jet lag, really. I told, I said to myself, I've got a look over there and I'm looking at, yeah, yeah, no. The first time I really struggled with jet lag… maybe I'm just getting old, I don't know. But it was. And I think coming also when I was in Chicago, I was having like meetings at four 30 in the morning. So I'm still waking up but then I was still kind of like doing a full day and… going to sleep at more like normal time over there et cetera. So yeah, it was, yeah, it was tough, Phoenix was eight hours away difference, but that was really good. So that was our first virto leadership conference which was, really good. So just to give you an update, we don't have any, I… what's it called… apis, right? So, for, so every co has been able to choose their own ppi, what they're going to run for. But what we want to, so down here is a company that we came from is it was like diverse slates, diverse late. You've got to hit 100 percent diverse slates, got to hit 50 percent hiring females. You've got to get, so if you're like on 34 percent fix organisation that's your jump off point and you have to get to 42. So there was always like, a jump off point and a year end target that we needed to make. We, we described that and it's more focusing on the equity inclusion but there needs to be one thing that we're going to run for. So links is going to run for diversely… but also factor in some equity and inclusion rather than diversity. So the focus to our people is going to be equity inclusion. And we're saying that if we focus on equity inclusion, the diversity will come itself because it's an evolution. Yeah. So we had a new VP of HR join. And yesterday, she was just like, I don't want you working on. And I, how I, why? So she wants me to work on your, in a strength finder. 

3:45 | Chloe
Yeah, god. Yeah, very bad. 

3:48 | Sairah
Yeah, because I'm a strength finder coach. She was, I want you to work on strength finder and I said, yeah, that's fine. Also, this thing that I was doing with you was going to be for links as well, but it was mainly for one of our companies called video jet which Rich is heading up from. He, he's one of the HR directors at video jet and he will be… he will probably be your better main point of contact going forward. So also I specifically and you don't need to share this with him but I'm being taken away from video jet. I was just doing it as a favor. All of this is a favor to video jet and think, you know, what links can come underneath it. So I would probably still want to see what we can do for links. But the major part of this is for video jet which Rich will probably be the better person to get in touch with. So, I can drop you his e-mail address as well and you can CC me into it and just say, look, we've been, you've done some work with me just I… video… gonna warn you. Video jets culture is awful like my sister companies to video jet. We've got a, very similar product. People want to leave video jet for less money to come here at length. Culture is, terrible. And I just, I, and I just don't know how to fix that. So I would suggest maybe getting in touch with Rich… because also he's doing stuff on culture. So he might even get gain kind of like a culture audit. And if we do a cultural audit and there's something that we need, it would be really good for him to tell you. Okay, what were, the gaps? And then how you could kind of plug in. And I know you asked me for examples and it was too hard to explain in the text. So I video has problems such as they had a like they've got no shame in what they say. There's just no filter… and what they do is… like they had it at the beginning of the year. They're in lisbon and it was as an indian woman or a guy, whoever it was, right? That was gonna present and somebody couldn't pronounce the name. He was like, yeah, it's probably some in the binder like because. 

6:38 | Chloe
Yeah, my god. 

6:40 | Sairah
And, that, I don't even know if that's a micro aggression like Jesus christ, I think I. 

6:46 | Chloe
Yeah. No, that's. 

6:48 | Sairah
so, if we're doing that, I, and you want the they're not in the… they're not in the space where they call things out. Also somebody who made… reference to some homosexual or Gay person as, you know, that person that, you know, they belong to those letters that left the community and it's just like Jesus christ. So, the, why I. 

7:16 | Chloe
is that, what is it like a certain demographic or like, is it, this, is it the type of business? Like, because what do video jet do? 

7:24 | Sairah
So, industrial printing. So, for example, it's the same what we do though. So, for example, just say like this is a bottle of all right. Can you see that bar code? 

7:37 | Chloe
Yeah, yeah. 

7:39 | Sairah
That's what they'll do, that and they'll do that on wires. They'll do it on pharmaceutical products. They'll do it on food and beverage. They'll do it on, but it's a really male dominated industry. Also, it's white mails… you know, it's only when you go to turkey, do you get the turkey, turkish people. So only when you go to india, you get the indians, but it's still all males. And in Europe, it's heavily white mails. 

8:08 | Chloe
Yeah. 

8:13 | Sairah
So he would probably be the best person to get in contact with when it comes to links is more it's started in my mom and dad's village, right? Which is 10 miles away from here. It's in just outside cambridge. It's this is the headquarters. We've got an office in france of 55 people. And then we've got distributors. So people that manage our distributors dotted around the world. So if you think about kind of like ego, it's probably more of a cambridge yep ego that we've got a content rather than any other ego but it's very family orientated. So there's people here that have been with each other to school or there's people here that she's my brother's friend because they went to school together. And that kind of feel 10 years. We've got some people that have been here for 35 years. We just celebrated somebody's twentieth… work anniversary. So there's that long tenure of like a stable amount of people and people are nice to each other because it's a small town and ives… but there's still some like ourselves. I'd say and some cultural thoughts. So, for example, I'll do I'll give you an example and I don't know if this is macro on micro. I think it's pretty macro. I was doing a strength session… and in that, I said… choose a celebrity, choose somebody who is well known in the world. It could be somebody who's a philanthropist. It could be somebody who's sportsman. It could be a politician. It could be anything that you want and just try to work out what their five type strengths are. And one. And I was like that's really cool. So they were like, you know, freedom fighter. So he had belief he had futuristic because he wanted a better future for south Africa. He wanted XY and Z, blah blah blah. And so I'm gonna say just some twat in the crowd was just like, yeah, but what would his strength been if you were to look at him as a terrorist. And I'm just like… terrorist that was a colonial country where somebody just, you know, we, it was over. He was imprisoned. He was a freedom fighter. He wanted independence back for his own country from the british empire. Blah blah blah I said, I don't think that's terrorism, right? So we've got that like that. But, you know what? We'll just be so open and say things. 

10:57 | Chloe
Yeah, it's just so comfortable and it probably is around that like they're from that town or they're so comfortable with everybody around them. If you've been there 20 years, you might feel that you can just say what you want and get away with it. Yeah. 

11:12 | Sairah
So that's kind of so again, I don't know if that's micro regression, macro regression. But when I just think about, this thing, the links. 

11:27 | Sairah
Like, what is it that I'm trying to solve? So diversity mix we have, we've got 33, 34 percent of, our females. I mean, I'm the only one of the are wanting… we've got a good even spread. We've got managers, but our sales organization doesn't have any diversity. So I'm kind of backtracking because now I'm just thinking of the lens of links before I was thinking of the lens of video jet and they've got so much to do and it was probably a bite sizes are probably the same. And I was looking at our D and I training that we have. Shall I send you a list of those? 

12:11 | Chloe
Yeah, that would be really helpful. And it's that usually run like face to face style training or is this online do it? 

12:19 | Sairah
Themselves? And I think the only thing when I was talking to my manager was let me just see if I can find this dni training. When I was talking to my manager. He was like, yeah, but care, well, I'll let people go their own way. Like we have Dan, I training… and people won't do it or people will just like how I do my compliance training every year. I just sit there and I just like go click. And then I just guess, the answers sometimes I get it sometimes fail and you just which one do you think, you know, and you kind of like ring the system that's what he doesn't want it to turn into? 

13:08 | Sairah
Let me put in our dni trains that we've got. 

13:20 | Sairah
I'm I cake to put it in the chat. 

13:23 | Chloe
Yeah, I think so good. 

13:31 | Chloe
So introduction. 

13:33 | Sairah
Unconscious bias practicing including fostering collaboration, embedding inclusion… that one and the ones underneath that there for people leaders. So the top ones are for associates only until embedding inclusion. And then people leaders have unconscious bias training… all of those ones underneath. Yeah. And then I don't know, do we start with managers? Do we start with all associates? 

14:07 | Chloe
I'm maybe, yeah, I. 

14:08 | Sairah
a little bit. 

14:10 | Chloe
Yeah, I think usually starting with managers is good just because they're the ones that can have so much impact on like the wider organisation. And yeah, that like you can kind of give them workouts and things that they can go away and do with their teams. But also, I think, you know, if we're looking at like a proof of concept or something finding like, a good group to start with, that really gives feedback and can really help us make sure it's right fit for links. It's also quite a good place to start. So, yeah. And, and so all of these trainings. So this is all on workday. Is that all right? All right. Yeah, that makes sense. And like, is this all mandatory as well? So they have to do this? 

15:04 | Sairah
I think so, let me just look at one of them. I can't remember, I… have been in for, but again, did I just go, click? 

15:16 | Chloe
Yeah, it's quite a lot to do really isn't it, how long? Yeah. How long are some of these? 

15:22 | Sairah
Hello? 

15:35 | Sairah
Me to send along? 

15:56 | Sairah
And I do managing bunches by. So we go self directed. 

16:11 | Sairah
This course has no lessons to, right? When telling people to do something, there's nothing on it. Let me just see practicing in really that's really bad. 

16:22 | Chloe
What is it just not working or? 

16:24 | Sairah
I know I've done it. I did do it. Let me see. So I can't remember doing it. 

16:31 | Chloe
Yeah. And that's the thing isn't it, it's not going to change people's behaviour and it's a. 

16:35 | Sairah
I really didn't do anything formally because I can't remember selfdirected course. There's no lessons. I haven't done this one. 

16:53 | Sairah
I'm sending people in immersion plans with all this in and there's, nothing on it. God. 

17:03 | Chloe
Yeah. And I suppose what's been the impact of all, a lot of people leaving? Has there been any kind of backlash on like the brand or is just something that you've noticed that you're like we need to sort this out. 

17:24 | Sairah
So, our turnover has gone down. So turnover last month was zero percent of any for April. We've we've had one leaver last week, but they go into a medical device company. They came from medical devices are going back into medical devices. 

17:48 | Sairah
So turnover hasn't been affected. I think it's more just the belonging piece. So we have or I'm just gonna look up our old trick. The I'm just gonna look up our engagement survey and it's not bad. But we need to do something, right? If I'm not doing anything… I think going to slip. Yeah. So we've got like an average score. It's gonna get my… score out. We'll come it out, bear with me… engagement… right? Give me two seconds. I'm just gonna log into. 

18:37 | Chloe
No good. 

18:46 | Chloe
To. 

18:50 | Sairah
2023 engagement dashboard. So if I look at hold on, let me just do that… results? 

19:33 | Sairah
Let me just go into item summary and I'll give you the deny breakdown… communication compliance, dubious diversity, right? I'm treated with respect regardless of my age, race, gender, physical capabilities, sexual orientation, and, or any other dimension of diversity. 92 percent agreed. So that's good leadership. My operating company is generally committed to attracting and developing and keeping a diverse workforce. 81 percent in my team, individuals can succeed to their full potential, regardless of age, race, gender, physical capabilities, sexual orientation, and all any other dimension. Diversity was 91 percent. My direct supervisor does a good job of managing people with diverse backgrounds regardless of age, race, gender, physical capabilities, sexual orientation, and, or any other dimension. Diversity was 89 percent. We actually dreamed since 2022. But like just like one point, the biggest one that we had was the leadership was three points. And then there was one dimension that we went up on by one percent. So they're not exactly. And then if I was to rate that against the rest of auto bear with me. 

21:03 | Chloe
And what was that with links, those results? 

21:05 | Sairah
Links? Yeah. 

21:07 | Chloe
Yeah. 

21:09 | Sairah
If I was to base that on? 

21:16 | Sairah
Based on bit… we were, is only one dimension that we were lower than links and that was by one point, which was the leadership of my operating company is generally committed to attract and developing and keeping diverse a diverse workforce. 

21:38 | Chloe
So, 

21:38 | Sairah
that wasn't an amazing conclusion. Can I just share my screen? So I don't have to read it out. 

21:46 | Chloe
Yeah, you can do. 

21:50 | Sairah
Modern technology, make use of it. Siren. So I will increase this somehow. 

22:01 | Sairah
Right. So here inclusion, I can be myself at work 88 percent if I was to compare this is just close these ones down so you can see. 

22:16 | Sairah
So this first one is to second one is our platform. So our group of companies. So if I was to go. 

22:31 | Sairah
Yeah, inclusion. Yeah. So look, our inclusion, we're a little bit lower. Yeah. So I can be myself at work. I feel as I can belong, but they're pretty high score. It's 86. 

22:45 | Chloe
Yeah, very high. 

22:47 | Sairah
So, I'm not gonna sweat over this. 

22:50 | Chloe
No, because that was the thing like… obviously a form isn't always a representative of the culture and like you're saying if you're witnessing the, yeah, micro regressions, macro regressions, like there's clearly something not right? But, yeah, are they just saying yes on the form to get it done… if they? 

23:16 | Sairah
Your model, is it? 

23:20 | Chloe
Elearning? Yeah, we can use like Jenny, I, to create… we create like workshops and things like that and we can empower like the leaders to go and run these sessions and we do have customer success that can help run like peer to peer discussions and things like that. 

23:38 | Sairah
I think that would probably help. So, would you say like, is it a physical person that comes in and does these sessions with us? 

23:46 | Chloe
Yeah, they typically do. Yeah, I mean, they typically do them like virtually like we do them like embedded kind of within the sprint, we're definitely leaning a bit more towards doing some of those, but it's more of like you do the like peer to peer learning on the platform in the group we content. And then we'll be like, right? Let's do a peer to peer discussion and that's where our customer success team will run that for you and really encourage people to share like examples or like we can kind of create like a workshop style approach. So, yeah, I think we could probably do them in person. We've definitely done the park. 

24:20 | Sairah
I think that would help to do it in person for our leadership team. And then our leadership team like maybe our L ones and our L2 and you're the ones that are going to translate this into your teams now? 

24:33 | Chloe
Yeah. 

24:36 | Sairah
If I was to think on links only video jet, you've got a, that is a beast when it comes to. 

24:43 | Chloe
Yeah. 

24:43 | Sairah
Let me show you their scores and I'll probably be… let me show you their scores. So that was like, I have a look at. 

25:14 | Sairah
What's his name? Andre crook? 

25:23 | Sairah
You see, I don't believe these numbers. 

25:27 | Chloe
That is quite high. I'm not seeing your other screen if I'm not sure if I'm on the right screen, I'm sorry? 

25:35 | Sairah
He, sorry. So just, 

25:36 | Chloe
in case, 

25:39 | Sairah
there you go. I do, I don't complete these numbers? Yeah. There you are. 

25:44 | Chloe
Very high. And I think that's it, it's like is there a culture around the engagement survey, like to people just think, yes, I'll just say everything's great unless they, but also, I think when you think about diversity inclusion, if I don't know, maybe the majority feel like they're included but they still app out and… I don't say the wrong thing. 

26:09 | Sairah
Yeah. I mean, look, their biggest problem was customer focus and communication and… but I find it really hard that if you've got a problem, I communication, how can you be, you know, the inclusion part? 

26:22 | Chloe
Yeah, yeah. I think that's quite a good one to link together like how are they communicating conclusively? 

26:31 | Sairah
Yeah, but should I give Rich the heads up that you're gonna be contacting him? But they mean you work on something links and I do think, I don't so when I was speaking to my manager about this, he was just like Sarah, he is it, well, he just, nothing is like, for example, he doesn't have very much faith in strengths finder and I'm like, no, we're going to do it, but there's only so so many things. I confess. He was just like Sarah. I don't think the, on leaving people online to do their own training, he would want, and I think this is from his strengths as well. He's very relationship driven. So, rather than people do it behind a screen, he was like, no, but I want people to talk. I want people to engage and learn through other people's experiences just rather than behind a screen. 

27:23 | Chloe
Yeah. 

27:24 | Sairah
So that would be helpful if we could get like he said… somebody to help us on that. 

27:33 | Chloe
Yeah. And that's the thing like I think it's yeah, trying to outline to the manager as well that it's not just like that mandatory training of just get going. Like we use a lot of engagement strategies to get people speaking to each other. We kick off of the launch webinar, so that's something that we always get everyone together for initially. And then it's just when they're not together, they have the online and they can still have the conversations. And then we can do a proper discussion in the middle and at the end. So there are things we can put around it and then we'll be nudging them as well. So, yeah, I can just, I'll continue that just like this business case and share it with you in the meantime. Yeah, if you could give a heads up, that would be great and I can set up a call with him. So, yeah, I'll do that. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, it'd be nice to catch up with him as well. And then I suppose what then needs to happen after that? Like would it be present to your manager, get them on board and then take it to somebody else or who? 

28:41 | Sairah
Just him? 

28:43 | Chloe
And is he the budget holder? 

28:47 | Sairah
I. 

28:48 | Chloe
am. 

28:49 | Sairah
five sneakers approval to gain burn a hole in the budget? Yeah. 

28:55 | Chloe
Cool. So, would it make sense for us to set up a time to meet with your manager or do you want to work on this? Let's work on a? 

29:07 | Sairah
Just so I know what he's like, yeah, he's not a household but he's just like… so he's one of our kind of like… a seed higher and probably he will run veto one day. So he's, very, much. I think, he can be quite specific but, he would want something bite size quick, probably more with interaction with people rather than, and also like success stories of how it's worked before. 

29:46 | Chloe
Yeah… yeah, great. 

29:52 | Sairah
And probably just a costing as well. 

29:55 | Chloe
Yeah, that'll be fine because, yeah, how many people would it be for? If it was links? I suppose if you did do managers or if you did do managing? 

30:04 | Sairah
So, if I was talking about the L1? 

30:18 | Sairah
Eight people for the L1, L2, I'd need to figure that out because some of us are in different countries and so, but if I was to say major teams? 

30:38 | Sairah
About another 10, maybe. 

30:46 | Chloe
And how many people are in links? Like all together? 300 is not linked, right? Are we talking about link? Yeah, we're talking about links all. Yeah, we are, so. 

30:58 | Sairah
Video is about 1,800. 

31:03 | Chloe
Okay. Yeah, that's helpful to understand. Yeah, I can definitely pull some pricing together then for that as well. Okay. So, yeah, should we just catch up in a couple of weeks and I'll just pull together everything you shared with me? Really, really helpful. You're definitely, right. It's easier to just have a conversation about it and then, yeah, you can take a look at what I've created and then if we side just anything, we can go from there. Okay. Great. Well, thank you. Nice to catch up and, you take care and you have a good week. Bye and you? 

31:37 | Sairah
Bye, bye, bye bye.
