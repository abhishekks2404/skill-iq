0:00 | Camille
hello? 

0:00 | Aroti
Cool. 

0:01 | Chloe
Hello, your voice? 

0:06 | Aroti
Close to. 

0:06 | Chloe
Your, I don't know if you're like. 

0:09 | Camille
Yeah, my camera's always like Zoom. 

0:10 | Chloe
Did is so annoying because I. 

0:12 | Aroti
I don't have a webcam? 

0:13 | Camille
On my laptop, I have to use this thing. So annoying. Yeah, I'm always very zoomed in. I don't really know what do about it. Just, like, hello? 

0:26 | Chloe
Yeah. So, yeah, I think if we give a bit of the intro, yeah, there's obviously a few, I think there's a few people that's gonna come on this call, understand me bit about what they're looking for. I… have like of another call. 

0:43 | Camille
Well, 

0:46 | Chloe
no, I will just be very much like, just make sure you wrap up by then and maybe try and schedule another call like a deeper demo if we don't get to a demo. And then, yeah, I think they might be a bit like, I'll be good to know this or this pricing, but I think just hold off on that until we've got a bit more information and. 

1:17 | Camille
Knowing by their timeline. So, how many calls have you had with them so far? 

1:21 | Chloe
No, no, this is like the very first. Yeah, I think I've met at another time. I haven't met any of the others. So, yes, it's just the first, he basically just emailed me asking for like… information around licenses and stuff, and our let's have a call when you're back. Yeah, I, do you want to lead, and then I'll just say, and I work with confirm more. Yeah, no. 

1:50 | Camille
Only want to lead, but I will lead. 

1:53 | Chloe
We can, we can, I can chime in as well, but, 

1:57 | Camille
thank, because I haven't actually. 

1:59 | Chloe
Cool. I see it. 

2:07 | Aroti
Hello? Camille? 

2:09 | Camille
No, no, yes, that's right. Yes. Hello. How are we doing? 

2:14 | Aroti
Very well. Thank you so much for making the time. Hey, Lisa. Hi, Lisa. How are you doing? 

2:21 | Alissa
Good. How are you all? 

2:23 | Camille
Good. Thank you. 

2:25 | Chloe
I suppose. 

2:26 | Camille
I should probably introduce myself. I think you, you'll know Chloe by e-mail but perhaps not me. So Chloe I think is let you know that she is very sadly leaving Hive. So, yes, I'm stepping into her shoes, very big boots to fill, but I'll be taking over, the relationship from here. Yeah, really excited to chat to you more today and find out a, I yeah, a bit more information on what you're looking for, what's interesting to you about Hive. And then hopefully we can get a follow up in, with slightly more time and we can kind of do a full demo of what you'd like to see that's useful and relevant for you on Hive. So, yeah, it'd be great to hear a little bit more about your roles and what's brought you to us. 

3:13 | Aroti
All right. So… start to hear you going, Chloe. We've actually not never met on a call on a video call, I think, but we've done several of these yeah, but we work together for the acquisition leaders, and that came out a, really well. So, Alisa and I are part of the people leadership credential program and that's essentially not so sure how much you know about the program, essentially leadership capabilities that we are developing at scale for all of accenture. It's a program that's open to anyone who is a leader today or aspires to be a leader. So it's completely career level agnostic. And… with that regards… we started to look at Hive. Keep in mind that, of course, I have a prior sort of relationship with Hive, so to say, because while we were developing content for the acquisition leaders that's when for the first time I sort of got involved in the Hive content, and the platform itself and what it can do. And our interest actually comes from there because all the material that we had put up on Hive in terms of, you know, the yc content that we've used, and, you know, project to live with I and experiences that we'd worked with is what we are also looking at for our people leadership. So, the first level was really about, so the people leadership credential is a multilayer program for our learners. And the first level was really about building the brilliant basics. And level two is about really… taking a track approach to learning, which essentially means that the learners can choose a particular track to work in and that provides for content context application practice all within the design that we've created and… I, and us and our teams have been working with a design for the I and track, the inclusive leadership track. But, the front and center of that entire track is really around the three seats that, you know, the framework that you have seen as well from is, and of course, how do we bring it to life with, you know, our 360 value proposition with inclusivety being a big part of it. So, so that's really the context of why we sort of started to look at Hive as well because all the material we've already we're talking about or all the material that's a part of our design is that we built out for Hive, right? So it's almost like a pick, you know, a plug and play sort of scenario for us. So… and Alisa has also been through, the platform. So we are right. So, Lisa, you've also seen the platform the Hive? 

6:06 | Alissa
Just briefly, I think I got in but I need that. So, yeah, yeah. 

6:11 | Aroti
Correct, correct. So, no. And what I really mean to say is that, we have a sense of what the platform can do or what it overall, looks like. I think our larger questions are really about, you know, what does the current contract look like with that central? How much might cost us to, if we go to plug in place sort of, you know, what we have, the two and a half hour content that we currently have, what might that cost us going forward? And besides what we saw… on Hive in terms of, you know, the look and feel and all of that. Is there anything more that we, in terms of capabilities that have high has and we didn't use for the acquisition leaders that could be of interest in terms of, you know, slightly different learning styles or something? Something cool, right? Yeah. And, and before you get into that, let me do a, let me take a minute to tell you that our level one is really cool, right? So we're trying to top it up with level two of saying, what else can we build out, right? So, yes, with that, Camille and Chloe, I'll pass it on to you that. 

7:20 | Camille
Thank you. I'm very excited to hear about the cool level one. Can you tell us a little bit more about what's exciting about that level? 

7:29 | Aroti
Absolutely. Elisa. Are you sure? 

7:33 | Alissa
Level one, we've got some really high quality videos. We've chunked them out into, you know, 20 minute chunks for each chapter. We've also incorporated learn by doing activities which are things that people can practice in the flow of their everyday work. So we're really trying to get relatable and something that they can use right then. And there, we were also able to incorporate knowledge checks, some information on how to go deeper, which are optional. And then we've got these really cool genai simulations that we link out to where people can practice having conversations in a safe space with the tool and people love those. So. 

8:16 | Chloe
That's. 

8:17 | Alissa
really neat. So, and we're also one of the first programs that went live on this workday platform in accenture. So we've got a lot of new factor kind of stuff in there. So we're trying to keep that level of excitement as we build out level too. 

8:33 | Chloe
Great. 

8:33 | Camille
And. 

8:35 | Aroti
and just on that because we were talking about cool things, right? Just, in the 20 minute videos that Alisa mentioned, it's a real life and real life as well. So, there are parts of sort of mesh world where, you know, you're yourself as an after and you have coaches who are also as avars, and, you know, they, you have your teaching moments there. So there is a live videos like this and then, you know, you sort of jump into a very virtual world with your own… sort of after doing some stuff there. So, so it's a very cool seamless sort of transition between the two worlds, and great learning moments there. So, yeah. 

9:17 | Camille
Well, love that. Thank you very much. And so with level two, are you looking to create a slightly different experience or similar? 

9:27 | Aroti
So, the experience is completely different. We're looking at while the level one was really all about self driven individual learning journeys, level two, we are trying to bring this to be a more personalized yet group sort of cohort driven experience. So it starts, with a self diagnostics, sort of, you know, who you are, what are some of your friends, and all of that bills into coaching circles based on a particular track. So if you're taking inclusive leadership, there is a six week coaching track, that you run in smaller cohorts. And, and then because learn by doing or working or learning in the flow of work is something that's front and center to, you know, our learning methodology. So this sort of then dives… into… work, learn fusion or learn by doing expeditions which are really then, you know, how do you bring what you've learned so far, to life? And this is where we require the content that we've been thinking about, is this is where, we were looking at Hive. We have something called a prep pack which is essentially that you've been through a group setting off, you know, live coaching and all of that. And then you go through something called a prep pack which gets you ready for the expeditions that you're gonna get into, right? The expeditions are the learn by doing sort of activities that you will dive into. But the prep back is really about, you know, getting yourself immersed into some of the framework that at venture has to offer some of the live experiences that they might be some sort of, you know, anything, that has to do with that particular track. So in this particular case, inclusive leadership three three ces. We have, the I'm forgetting the name, the three frameworks that we are essentially bringing to life through our inclusive leadership material there. And we've dealt into all of these with the Hive platform as well for the acquired leaders. 

11:35 | Chloe
Mm. Hmm. Great. 

11:36 | Camille
Thank you. And just so I'm clear on the terminology, when you say track, do you mean kind of the, I suppose the cycle or, the training as a whole? 

11:46 | Alissa
So, for level two, there will be different topics that the learner can select. And we're calling that a track that will go down to I and D will be a track we're looking at, you know, leading through change as a track and be different? 

12:01 | Camille
Yeah. And I. 

12:04 | Aroti
A learning path? 

12:05 | Camille
Okay. 

12:06 | Aroti
It a learning path? Yeah, I. 

12:10 | Chloe
I think that's quite, a good point in terms of like obviously, we've already got the inclusive leadership track that we've already created for the men program. But what we can also see today is our buzz curator tool that basically allows you to create content really quickly so we could create content for your other tracks as well, which could be quite good in terms of you can also upload documents to say, use this as source material. So you might have some like pieces of content already, and then it will create you a like six week learning sprint, for example. Yeah, it might be quite a nice way then to have Hive where then you've got all the different groups, so the different tracks, but yeah, that could be something that we could help with as well. But yeah, we can show you some of that. 

12:56 | Camille
Absolutely. 

12:57 | Aroti
And happy to explore, you know, various possibilities because, our current knowledge is very limited to what we saw in acquired leaders, right? So, and that's the other thing that I do honestly, I'm sure I was capable of a lot more. So what is that? A lot more? 

13:10 | Camille
Yeah. 

13:11 | Aroti
I'll. 

13:11 | Camille
I'll just give you a bit of an overview because it might be useful for your understanding of Hive in case you haven't seen it. But you're familiar with, the platform and the peer learning space that we've created. We, we do foster environments whereby you can create a learning environment with your peers who might be globally dispersed and, you know, work in different departments or sectors, gives them, a place to learn together. So that's very much fundamental to Hive, who we are and how we work. I think, it definitely sounds like that's what you're looking for level two as well as that we have, I suppose in the last probably six months to a year pivoted as I'm sure a lot of companies have done and are now very a I centric in what we've developed in terms of the tools. So you mentioned for level one that you've used essentially what I understood to be an AI coach kind of working through one to one scenarios with the individual. And so we've developed something similar there as well. However where we have created our own AI coach, the way that we use it, we, our understanding is a little bit different to, you know, you're kind of standardly learning module. So the learner would experience a particular scenario via the AI coach whilst they're going through a particular module or a track. In this example. So if you've got one about, I don't know, let's say giving inclusive feedback, there would be an opportunity within that learning experience that as they click through on Hive to have that kind of one to one scenario based conversation. And we'll work with you to determine what the prompts are. So it feels really valuable and specific to accenture. So the user very much feels like it's their vision and values as the company, it feels very personal to them and it's coaching exactly what the content is trying to teach them. So it helps them put it into action immediately. So that's something that we could potentially look at which appreciate you want this to be a different experience. But I think it would feel different enough because it's so intrinsic to that learning experience and the journey itself… taking a little step back as to how we would approach, the content creation and the program slash track content piece. Another tool that we've built. We, we call it buzz curator and this is essentially to help you build a learning program in the space of a couple of minutes. So we should have time for a quick demo in just a moment and that will help you. Take the ownership on what you want to create and how you want to create it. Some clients still prefer, to ask Hive to do it. So they just let us know exactly what, they want to create and we can go away with our learning experience team and create it. But where we've got learning designers and learning consultants… actually, it's quite useful, to give it to you, give you the product, and to let you create it, can cut some of that time out as well as that, for any programs that are created via buzz curator. Our third tool is buzz insights. So this is something that we haven't really seen elsewhere in the market. And I think this will really help you prove impact to your stakeholders internally. What it will do is it will pull automated reports on all of the data from our very data Rich platform and be able to give us really useful insights that aren't just completion rates and engagement data. It goes beyond that to tell us things like people are struggling with the concept of psychological safety. So we need to deal deeper here. It shows us where we might need to pivot or this particular person is really driving the conversation with valuable contributions. And so then we can reach out to them and encourage them to do more of that to keep a really vibrant and lively community of peer learning happening. So so that's kind of, our three piece gen AI suite if you will. And it seems like the buzz facilitato as we call it, or your AI coaches concept that you're familiar with. Have you seen anything else yet? Like buzz curator as I've explained it or buzz insights? 

17:25 | Aroti
Curator? Yes, insights. No. 

17:30 | Camille
Yeah. And is that something that you're working on internally in terms of buzz curator? 

17:38 | Aroti
No, I've just seen other ecosystem partners who also have, are working on similar lines. But again, I think you're essentially your strength is coming in the fact that you're creating this, as a whole suite of AI sort of driven, you know, right from curation to facilitation to delving into insights as well. So, it almost becomes like a one stop shop for your client. 

18:02 | Camille
Yes, exactly. 

18:03 | Aroti
That's exciting. Yeah, yeah. 

18:05 | Chloe
I think, yeah, the way I often think about it is like when you suddenly need to fill us a skill gap that you might never know was coming or you need to be quite reactive, for example, Jenny like how do we upskill people on ji and making sure that they're ready five years ago? It might not be curious. Traitor is really putting like this tool in your hands where it empowers you, your learning teams. I mean you can even give this to a subject matter expert or a team leader to quickly build a learning sprint or a learning track to really help up skill their team quickly. And it could be really tailored to like you and your organisation and use it to kind of align with previous pieces of content that you have. The second part is right? Okay. How do we help these leaders? And these learners actually practice those skills and have that personalization? Have that one to one support that you might not be able, to give to everyone but still be in a group cohort with their peers? And then how do we use that insight to really attract the impact that it's having? Giving, that, those insights back to a business leader, that ROI. And again, it actually recognizes future skill gaps, what people talking about on the platform that you might not have even thought of yet. So when you have those insights, you then use buzz curator to create a learning sprint on it. So it's kind of see is like this circle of you see a gap, you fill it, you see a gap, you fill it and it kind of gives you the tools in your hands to do it yourselves. So, I suppose with the current accenture being a pilot, like we're not really using. Obviously, we did use buzz greater in the background to create a content. Otherwise we're not really using this suite current. So, I suppose this does just build the bigger picture on what else we can do as well. 

19:52 | Aroti
Absolutely. So this is very exciting. Of course, the one thing that worries me is as more and more ecosystem partners are coming back with do it yourself experiences. I'm like you're going to get, very exhausting of the appointment. That is only so much that I can do it myself. Yeah. But, I do wanna see a live demo of how this works in terms of, you know, what does the curation look like and how quickly can one do it? Then, of course, moving on to what, you know, how seamless is the facilitate experience? And I'm guessing are there some a demo pieces that we can look at and play around with in terms of the facilitato? And of course, I'm most excited to see the insights part in terms of what does some of the reportings look like? And, you know… and you know, as I'm also thinking we have our own of course, measurement strategy and a great one at that, for level one and level to building out. But maybe this could be one part that could allow us to also build into our measurement strategy, if this becomes a part of our prep pack, right? 

20:55 | Alissa
Sure. Yeah. 

20:56 | Camille
Awesome. 

20:58 | Aroti
Well, I think, yeah, let me know what. 

21:00 | Camille
Most valuable. Well, I'm thinking I can give a very quick demo some conscious. We've only got a few more minutes left at this meeting. So I can show you in theory what the tool would look like. And then perhaps we hop on a call either later this week or next week to kind of do, a kind of, yeah, a Fuller demo as it were. And I can give you a quick look at one of the reports so that you get a feel for what sort of data would be at your fingertips off the back of running a sprint. I think it's also worth while noting here that there are different approaches to how you Hive which I touched on earlier. We have some clients who very much want to go away and create, you know, hundreds of module themselves, and then other clients like it seems yourselves who actually don't have the capacity to do that. And that's where we come in and that's how you want to use Hive that we are, you know, looking after that piece for you. We're creating these very kind of intricate and very well thought out modules with the support from you from the objectives and the outcomes that, you know, that you're looking to achieve. So, yeah, I think it would be good, to chat through that a little bit more at some stage, to work out the ways of working, and what exactly you're looking for because there's a few different ways to approach it from a service level perspective if that makes sense. 

22:18 | Aroti
Sure, absolutely, that makes sense. Of course, in terms of the sprints you have running, what we should look at is leading through change. But what's most exciting here is of course, dog behavior training. 

22:28 | Chloe
How do you, are you? 

22:32 | Camille
So I will, I'll give you a peak of dog behavior training. But yeah, this is just my little playground essentially of different sprints I've built in the last sort of week or so as you can see some people take it quite seriously. They want to have a look at, you know, what could it deliver on leading through change? Other people just want to see, you know, they want to kind of test it and be like, could you do something on this? Like how out there could we go? So, yeah, I think, it could be a demo on anything that would be useful there, but really straightforward to get started. You just hit create a new sprint create with buzz. And we have also just launched a document upload feature. So if you have things like I don't know leadership vision and values dark or leadership framework or anything like that kind of thing that you might want to use to inform what it's creating, you can upload a few docs and that will help inform what you're building just in the interest of time we won't upload a doc here or just go straight to chatting with buzz. But when we've got a bit more time, what we can potentially do is, yeah, have a look at creating, a kind of yeah, first draft example. If you've got any docs that you want to see it consume in our next call, I think that would potentially be quite useful. But if you want, yeah, if there's anything in particular as weird and wacky or as relevant as you might want it to be, is there anything in particular that you'd like to see it start building a sprint out on? 

23:57 | Aroti
We could check the example of a inclusive leadership, and you guys already know the content. So that could be an easy one to do. Yeah. 

24:03 | Camille
Yeah. So so let's say a sprint on inclusive leadership. So this goes very much beyond your usual chat gpt as I'm sure you're expecting and essentially what its purpose is to find out more. So it will continue questioning us until it's got enough information to go on and what's happening over on the right hand side is it will start to build out the sprint objectives. It will find out more information about the audience, the background context, the cadence and start building out the pathway titles. I'll ask you these questions because I'm sure you'll give much more valuable and succinct answers. So buzz next question is, can you tell me a little bit about the sprint? You'd like to build on inclusive leadership? 

24:49 | Aroti
So instead of doing this, can you showcase, so I get the sense, can you showcase me something that actually got developed? Can you show me a pathway that's been built through this? 

24:59 | Camille
Yeah, yeah, sure. So I'll show you a first draft one and then you a, I can show you one that we've played around with a bit more. So I can't remember if this was one that I did with an existing client. But so leading through change, the chat, you can just see here, kept it really straightforward. So we're expecting quite fundamental like not super detailed here. Again, this was part of a demo that I did leading through change program, getting teams to engage with change, be resilient through change, manage complexity, feel comfortable with changes relevant for managers, all levels. So this is kind of really kind of brief answers that I'm giving it. And it's suggested then the pathway names in the breakdown of what it might entail here. Then if I click into one of the cards, you can see this one here which is all about the types of change. It just in the space of a few minutes, was able to build this out for me. So it gives me a bit more understanding of the different types of change, the transformational, incremental, developmental remedial, and they're giving me some by size key takeaways, and over to me section to help me think about how I'm going to action. This where we then get a bit more creative is we would edit the content and we'd embed various different pieces to keep it interesting and engaging for the user. So for example, we can add image blocks. We can add videos. You mentioned that there's some videos that, you may have that you may want to embed there. We can also do pull questions and quizzes, and then this is where we can integrate the buzz facilitatorai coach conversation. So the system message here is basically what we want buzz to do. So it might say in this particular example, test the user on their knowledge of the different types of change and ask them to think about how they're going to implement one role play, a way to implement it or something like that. And then the assistant message is that first message to get the user started. So it'll be something like today, we're going to work on a particular area of change and which one would you like to focus on? Yeah, that sort of thing might be relevant for this. So we can build that within the card basically. 

27:15 | Aroti
And you're saying that there is the possibility of… the buzz curator being like a do it yourself for your clients as well, right? So we could just run with it and sort of. 

27:27 | Camille
Yeah, very much. So, so if you wanted to just go for it and we can put you and a in a testing group, they're both of you if you want to have a little play around with it, you know, it's quite intuit. So hopefully you'll be able to figure it out but you can always let us know if you get a bit stuck. And then, yeah, perhaps we touch base. Then next week, once you've had an opportunity to have a bit of a play just very quickly, we'll try and get some time in. But the… AI reporting which I'll go in a bit more detail looks a bit like this. This is a example from a live client who are quite happy for a demo, this particular example. So you can see it will give us things like, you know, your usual engagement data, completion rates, et cetera. But it will summarize them and let us know various different insights. So, yeah, and even things like, you know, advice on consistent dropping the number of participants, suggesting some members are not continuing the subsequent pathways that might be then assigned for us to intervene. And we could then get comes out to that group and say, make sure you're participating. It helps us understand those bits and pieces as well. So would something like this be useful and relevant for you? 

28:39 | Aroti
On first looks, yes, it does seem like something that might be of interest. What do you, what do you think Elisa? 

28:53 | Alissa
Sorry, I was just saying, I agree, I think this is really cool. I love that it shares the insights right there for you. 

29:00 | Camille
Yeah, it just makes it so much easier for you to report back and to share the insights with your wider team. But again, as we said, you know, even some of these kind of behavior change type summaries have been, we found really valuable for communicating with our most senior kind of C suite stakeholders. A lot of the insights are now being shared in board reports for various L and D teams that we work with where their head of L and D needs to report back into C suite level. So yeah, it's definitely helped take the value and impact part of what Hive do for clients to the next level. 

29:36 | Aroti
Yeah, no, absolutely. I think as next steps. So first of all, I think insights are nowadays looking more and more like medical reports. 

29:45 | Alissa
Thomas. 

29:47 | Aroti
So, what should be the next steps, which is a good thing… I think is next steps, let's set up some time next week and let's go through the three to just, you know, play around in the meanwhile. If you could of course, assign us to the testing group. And that would be me, Elissa and Dan, who is also at, the invite for this one. And we can get started at least playing around, with the system, right? Is that helps us? 

30:13 | Alissa
Yeah, yeah. 

30:15 | Aroti
Brilliant. And let's next week. Then let's block some time, maybe a 45 minutes. If we are, you know, we can get the three or three parts of the, yeah. So three things. So we could spend 15 minutes on each and get a good sense of what's happening. 

30:29 | Chloe
Yeah, sounds good. Just in terms of if for like for pricing and we can bring that to our next call. How many people would you look to be going on like this inclusive leadership track? Or I guess even the wider program, we can bring some scales? 

30:46 | Aroti
So slightly early in the day, to have a number there. But the ballpark that we're running with is, so as I mentioned, it's a multi thing, right? So the first one, the first level is of course open to everybody at, a center and the numbers are going to be the greatest there. Currently, we've just launched a couple of months back and we're already seeing about 23, no 32,000, Elissa. 

31:12 | Alissa
Not sure. Yeah… yeah. 

31:16 | Aroti
In that ballpark, right? But, but the point is that level two is going to be much lesser. And there in, we have multiple tracks. So, the number further is going to get split into these learning tracks. I'm thinking for starters somewhere in the ballpark of about a 1,000 to about 3,000 for the next couple of months might be a good ballpark to run with. But again, this is also these numbers and our projections are, very new to us as well. So I think as we go along, we're going to have to pivot and see what works best in terms of the numbers as well. Yeah. 

31:51 | Alissa
Yeah. And we have to be prepared to scale, you know, too much larger numbers if there's a. 

31:55 | Chloe

31:56 | Aroti
Correct, correct. And I know we are on over time, but I do wanna leave you all, with the thought of as Alissa pointed out for accenture. This is, this program has been a pioneer in many ways, right? And it's the first of many. And this is the first time that we are doing something which is career level agnostic. It's leadership development across the board for everybody.

But this is going for everybody is going to be a part of this. This is something much bigger than what we've ever seen in accenture, right? So, for whosoever joins us on the ride, I think this is going to be, well, have a hell of full experience a. 

32:50 | Alissa
Learner and. 

32:51 | Aroti
otherwise as well, right? So, yeah, and said, let's explore the opportunities of what we can do together. And yeah, I look forward to seeing more of a.
